      description: "From 17:02 - 18:44 UTC, the Spaces API experienced availability dips. These dips caused Spaces bucket operations in SGP1 for a subset of users to experience latency or 503 errors. \n\nThe fix implemented by our Engineering team has been monitored and availability for the Spaces API is stable. Users should be able to interact with their Spaces buckets successfully. \n\nIf you continue to experience any issues, please reach out to the Support team from within your account."
