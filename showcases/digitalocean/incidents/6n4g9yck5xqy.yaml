      description: "Our Engineering team is continuing to investigate the root cause of the issue with intermittent unavailability of Droplet metrics in the BLR1 region. Multiple reproduction efforts and testing against potential root causes are underway. Due to the sporadic nature of the issue, we anticipate incident updates for this issue to be less frequent, but we will share new information as soon as it is available.\n\nAt this time, users impacted by this incident will experience intermittent gaps in monitoring graphs for Droplets in BLR1, as well as delayed notifications for Resource Alerts (for any resources in BLR1). \n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience, and we'll share an update once we have more information."
