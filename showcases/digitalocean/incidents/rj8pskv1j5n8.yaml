        Our Engineering team is continuing to investigate the cause of the issue with networking in our SFO3 region and is taking action to mitigate this incident by reverting recent changes. In addition to connectivity issues, users may see failures with provisioning Load Balancers in SFO3.

        We are seeing some services recover, but expect to see a few more short periods of network connectivity issues as the reverts progress.

        We will continue to share updates as soon as we have new information.

        From 13:09 - 14:48 UTC, we experienced an issue with IPv6 network connectivity in our SFO3 region. Our Engineering team was able to identify the root cause, revert changes, and resolve the issue.

        During that time, connectivity via IPv6 to services in SFO3 was impacted. This included, in particular, connectivity to and provisioning of Load Balancers, control plane connectivity to Kubernetes clusters, and connectivity to App Platform Apps.

        If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team. Thank you for your patience and we apologize for any inconvenience.
