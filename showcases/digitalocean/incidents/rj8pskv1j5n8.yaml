        Our Engineering team is continuing to investigate the cause of the issue with networking in our SFO3 region and is taking action to mitigate this incident by reverting recent changes. In addition to connectivity issues, users may see failures with provisioning Load Balancers in SFO3.

        We are seeing some services recover, but expect to see a few more short periods of network connectivity issues as the reverts progress.

        We will continue to share updates as soon as we have new information.
