        Our Engineering team is investigating an issue that is impacting all control plane operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for all non-Mongo Managed Database clusters. During this time, users may encounter long running queries when attempting those operations, including provisioning new clusters, listing clusters, etc.

        In addition, App Platform deploys with Managed Databases are also affected, which may result in delayed or failed deployments for some applications.

        We will provide updates as more information becomes available.

Users should now be able to perform standard database operations successfully. App Platform deployments with Managed Databases should also be succeeding now. \n\nWe are now monitoring the situation in order to ensure stability and will post an update once the issue is resolved completely."
