      description: "Our Engineering team is investigating an issue causing delays in Droplet event processing in our FRA1 region. \n\nThis includes operations such as creating, resizing, powering on/off, or deleting Droplets. These actions may take longer than usual to complete or may appear to be temporarily stalled.\n\nOur engineering team is actively working to identify the root cause and restore normal processing speeds as quickly as possible. We will continue to provide updates here as we make progress."

      description: "Our Engineering team has identified the cause of the issue causing delays in Droplet event processing in our FRA1 region, and has implemented a fix. \n\nWhile investigating this issue, our Engineers also observed some events appearing to be stuck or delayed in the AMS2, BLR1, SGP1, NYC1, and SYD1 regions. As of now, the event processing rates have returned to normal in all these regions.\n\nWe are currently monitoring the situation and will post an update as soon as the issue is fully resolved."
