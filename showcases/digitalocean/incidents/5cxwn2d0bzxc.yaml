        Our Engineering team is investigating an issue with users attempting to sign up for new cloud.digitalocean.com accounts. At this time, users attempting to sign up are unable to do so, due to an issue with finalizing credit card information. Existing users are unaffected and should be able to sign in normally.

        We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.
