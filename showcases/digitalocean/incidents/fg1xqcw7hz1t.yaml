        Our Engineering team identified an issue with accessing Cloud Panel and Application deployment which is due to the increased level of HTTP 499 errors rates at Upstream Provider end.

        From 04:21 - 06:06 UTC, users may have experienced issues while accessing Cloud Panel and Application deployments.

        Our Upstream provider and the Engineering team closely worked together to resolve the issue.

        The impact has completely subsided and users should no longer see any issues with the impacted services.

        If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team from your Cloud Control Panel. Thank you for your patience, and we apologize for any inconvenience.
      resolved: true
