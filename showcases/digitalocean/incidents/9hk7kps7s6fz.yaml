        Our Engineering team identified and resolved an issue with IPv6 networking in the BLR1 region.

        From 12:15 UTC - 15:32 UTC, users may have experienced issues connecting to Droplets and Droplet-based services in the BLR1 region using IPv6 addresses.

        Our Engineering team quickly identified the root cause of the incident to be related to a recent maintenance in that region and implemented a fix.

        We apologize for the disruption. If you continue to experience any issues, please open a Support ticket from within your account.
