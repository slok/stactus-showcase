        Our Engineering team is investigating reports that alerts are not received when alerts are configured with tags. Users may not receive email notification of alerts when using tags, although resources specified by name are still monitored and receiving alerts properly.

        We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.

        Our engineering team has implemented a fix for the issues that affect receiving monitoring alerts for tagged resources, and are currently monitoring the situation. Any alerts that should've been received beginning February 6th to today will not be received, but new alerts for tagged resources should work going forward.

        We appreciate your patience, we will post an update once we've confirmed the issue is fully resolved.
