        Our Engineering team is currently investigating reports of SSL/TLS handshake failures for Object Storage access in FRA1 and SFO3 regions. Affected users may see connection errors or timeouts when attempting to access buckets over HTTPS.

        We are actively working to identify the root cause and implement a solution and will share further updates as more information becomes available.

      description: "Our Engineering team has identified the root cause of the issue as a block imposed by a third-party provider on users utilizing residential cable services and their advanced security offerings.\n\nDuring this time, a subset of users accessing their Spaces buckets in the FRA1 and SFO3 regions via residential cable services may have experienced SSL/TLS handshake failures.\n\nThis block was removed as of 17:48 UTC, and users should no longer encounter errors when accessing the contents of their buckets. \n\nWe are actively working with the third-party provider to ensure that such blocks are not imposed again in the future.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation and post an update once this issue is fully resolved. Thank you for your patience."
