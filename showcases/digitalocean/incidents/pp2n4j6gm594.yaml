        Our Engineering team is currently investigating reports of SSL/TLS handshake failures for Object Storage access in FRA1 and SFO3 regions. Affected users may see connection errors or timeouts when attempting to access buckets over HTTPS.

        We are actively working to identify the root cause and implement a solution and will share further updates as more information becomes available.
