        Our Engineering team has identified and resolved an issue that impacted the Load Balancers associated with Kubernetes Clusters for a brief duration.

        From 05:25 - 07:54 UTC, a subset of users may have experienced issues with accessing and connecting to Load Balancers associated with Kubernetes Clusters and may have noticed failed health checks for the Load Balancers.

        Also from 7:50 - 8:40 UTC, our Engineering team observed an issue with the App Platform. A subset of users may have faced issues with connecting to outbound dependencies from the App platform.

        Swift action was taken by our Engineering team that restored service and all services are operating correctly.

        We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any questions or continue to experience issues, please reach out via a Support ticket on your account.
