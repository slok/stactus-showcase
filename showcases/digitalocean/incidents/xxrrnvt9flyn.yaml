        Our Engineering team is actively investigating an issue causing some Droplets to become unresponsive due to guest-level errors. Affected users may find that their Droplets intermittently hang, requiring a power cycle to restore access.

        We've identified that this behavior is occurring on a subset of Droplets running Ubuntu 20.04. The standard support for Ubuntu 20.04 has ended, which may contribute to the observed behavior in certain configurations. We recommend affected customers consider updating their Droplets to a currently supported operating system, such as Ubuntu 24.04, to ensure continued stability and support.

        We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience as we continue to investigate and work toward a resolution. We will share further updates as more information becomes available.
