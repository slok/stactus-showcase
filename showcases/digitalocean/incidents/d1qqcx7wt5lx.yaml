        Our engineering team is investigating an issue with our managed certificates service due to an unexpected outage from our Certificate Authority.

        During this time, users may experience issues creating new certificates, provisioning or scaling MongoDB clusters, and issuing certificates for use with LBAAS and CDN services. Additionally, this may cause a subset of new custom domains on App Platform to take longer than usual to become active.

        We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide updates as soon as we receive more information.
      investigating: true
