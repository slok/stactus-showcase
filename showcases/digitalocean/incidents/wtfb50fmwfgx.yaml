        Our Engineering team identified and resolved an issue impacting multiple services, in multiple regions.

        From 19:53 - 20:22 UTC, users may have experienced errors with the following operations, for all regions:
        Droplet creates with a root password
        Droplet root password resets
        Droplet Snapshots
        MongoDB cluster creates
        Letâ€™sEncrypt certificate creation (for Load Balancers and Spaces)
        LoadBalancer creation with certificates
        Spaces bucket and key creations
        Fetching CSV invoices
        Bulk actions in the Spaces UI

        Additionally, users could have seen latency while creating and updating Apps.

        Our Engineering team quickly identified the root cause of the incident to be an incorrect firewall policy applied to core infrastructure and rolled back the change.

        We apologize for the disruption. If you continue to experience any issues, please open a Support ticket from within your account.
      resolved: true
