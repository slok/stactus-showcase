        Our Engineering team has implemented changes to optimize traffic routing in the BLR and SGP regions, addressing networking issues stemming from our upstream providers, which are affected by major submarine cable outages in the APAC region. Despite these adjustments, users may still encounter intermittent packet loss or connectivity issues when accessing resources in the affected areas. We are working with our upstream vendors to gain further insights and achieve a definitive resolution.

        We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

      description: "Our Engineering team confirms that multiple subsea cable cuts are impacting connectivity in the APAC region, which also affects traffic to Europe and the U.S. East Coast. \n\nTraffic is being rerouted through alternate paths to maintain service continuity. As a result, users may experience higher latency and intermittent connectivity issues.\n\nOur engineering team continues to monitor the situation closely and is working with upstream providers as repair efforts progress. We will share further updates as they become available.\n\nWe apologize for the disruption and appreciate your patience."

        Significant submarine cable outages continue to impact multiple network carriers on the Indian subcontinent, with increased latency and packet loss to our BLR1 region occurring sporadically throughout the day.

        On a positive note, our upstream providers have worked diligently over the past couple of days to minimize the impact of the loss of submarine capacity. As a result, we are now mainly seeing service degradation during the busier evening peak hours only.

        For the moment, we have no updates to provide regarding when the situation might improve. Repair times for submarine cables are typically on the order of weeks or months. However, further short-term improvements may still be possible as upstream carriers work to re-balance traffic where feasible.

        Separately, we continue to look into potential avenues for additional mitigations and will keep our customers aprised as we make progress in this area.

        We apologize for the ongoing inconvenience created by this extraordinary situation and thank our customers for their patience.

        Our Engineering team has observed significant improvements with the network latency and packet loss during peak hours today. This is a result of our upstream providers making some routing adjustments. We are carefully monitoring the network performance for the next 24 hours.

        We will communicate any further relevant information as we have it. We apologize for the inconvenience in the meantime.
