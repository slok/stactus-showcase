        We are continuing to investigate the network connectivity issue with Managed Kubernetes clusters.

        During this investigation, we have also identified an earlier period of network connectivity disruption affecting all services in the region, from 22:25 to 22:50 UTC.

        At this time, some Managed Kubernetes clusters may continue experiencing network connectivity issues, but all other services in the region should be accessible as normal.
