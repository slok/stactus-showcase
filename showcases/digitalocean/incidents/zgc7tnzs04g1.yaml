      description: |-
        From 05.45 to 9.20 UTC, our Engineering team observed a Networking issue in the SFO3 and AMS3 region related to DDoS mitigation workflows. During this time, a subset of Droplets remained in protective filtering longer than intended due to a monitoring issue in AMS3 that caused a small number of IPs to stay blocked incorrectly. Users should no longer be experiencing these issues.

        We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any questions or continue to experience issues, please reach out via a Support ticket on your account.
      resolved: true
