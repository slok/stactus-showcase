        During the timeframe 06:24 UTC – 13:45 UTC, the Gradient AI platform experienced a period of degraded functionality affecting a limited set of features. While the platform remained accessible, the below components did not perform as expected.

        Impacted Areas:
        - Gradient Agent Evaluations
        - Agent trace visibility
        - Access management for traces
        - Agent deletion for agents with traces enabled

        Our Engineering team identified the underlying cause and restored full functionality across all affected components. The platform has remained stable since resolution, and monitoring confirms normal performance.
      resolved: true
