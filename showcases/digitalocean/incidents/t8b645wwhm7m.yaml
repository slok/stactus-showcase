        Our Engineering team is currently investigating an issue affecting the Droplet limit increase feature within the Cloud Control Panel.

        At this time requests to increase Droplet limits submitted through the Control Panel are not being processed. Customer submissions to increase limits are not generating support tickets as expected. We are actively working to identify the root cause and restore normal functionality as quickly as possible.
