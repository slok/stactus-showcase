        Our Engineering team is investigating an issue that is impacting all control plane operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for all non-Mongo Managed Database clusters. During this time, users may encounter 401/403 errors when attempting those operations, including provisioning new clusters, listing clusters, etc.

        In addition, App Platform deploys with Managed Databases are also affected, which may result in delayed or failed deployments for some applications.

        We will provide updates as more information becomes available.
