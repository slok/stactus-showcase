        Our Engineering team has identified an issue that is impacting the creation of Managed Databases through the DigitalOcean Cloud Panel and API. During this time a subset of users may experience errors or delays when attempting to provision new database clusters.

        We are actively working on a solution in order to restore the service. Existing database clusters remain operational and are not affected by this issue.

        We will provide updates as more information becomes available.
