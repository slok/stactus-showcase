      description: "Our Engineering team has observed issues with our Support Portal. During brief, recurring outages, users are unable to access the Support Portal at https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/. We are aware of these events and our engineers are working with our vendor to resolve this. \n \nAs this issue is intermittent, we expect users will be able to log support tickets normally. However, during any periods of unavailability, as a temporary workaround, users may still contact us via the form here: https://www.digitalocean.com/company/contact/support\n\nThank you for your patience. We will post an update as soon as further information becomes available."
