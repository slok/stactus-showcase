        Our Engineering team is currently investigating an issue with fetching DBaaS cluster logs, affecting all non-MongoDB clusters.

        Affected users may encounter 500 errors when attempting to retrieve logs via the API, and no logs will appear in the Recent Logs tab.

        We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide updates as soon as we have more information. Thank you for your patience.

        Our Engineering team has now mitigated the issue that affected the DBaaS cluster logs and is currently being monitored. Users should no longer see 500 errors when attempting to retrieve the logs via the API. The "Recent Logs" section in the Logs & Queries tab of the UI should now display logs as expected.

        We are continuing to monitor the situation closely to ensure stability. Thank you for your patience during the process and we will provide a final update once we confirm the issue is fully resolved.
