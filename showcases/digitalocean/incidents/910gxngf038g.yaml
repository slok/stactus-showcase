        Our Engineering team is currently investigating an issue with fetching DBaaS cluster logs, affecting all non-MongoDB clusters.

        Affected users may encounter 500 errors when attempting to retrieve logs via the API, and no logs will appear in the Recent Logs tab.

        We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide updates as soon as we have more information. Thank you for your patience.
