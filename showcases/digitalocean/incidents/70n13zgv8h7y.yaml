        Our Engineering team is investigating an issue with Droplet creation in multiple regions. During this time, users may see an elevated failure rate for the creation of Droplets and other Droplet-based products, such as Load Balancers, Managed Databases, or Kubernetes in multiple regions. Already running Droplets should not be affected, however, users might not be able to resize their Droplets during this time.

        We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.

        Our Engineering team is continuing to investigate the issue with Droplet creation in all regions. During this time, users won't be able to see the Droplet sizes when creating regular/basic Droplets from the Cloud Panel, blocking creates except for the default size Droplet in each region. Resizes for existing basic Droplets are unavailable. Users are also unable to create Load Balancers, Managed Databases, and Kubernetes Clusters via the Cloud Control Panel and will see errors on those pages.

        API requests for creating and resizing Droplet-based resources are also impacted.

        At this time, our team is working as quickly as possible to mitigate the impact from this incident and is investigating potential workarounds.

        We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.

        Our Engineering team has identified the reason behind the failed Droplet creates and implemented a fix to resolve the issue. Users should now be able to create Droplets and Droplet-based services, including Managed Kubernetes, Managed Databases, and Load Balancers without any issues. Users should no longer see any errors when resizing their existing Droplets from the API as well as the Cloud Panel.

        We are actively monitoring the situation and will post an update as soon as the issue is fully resolved.
