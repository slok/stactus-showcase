        Our Engineering team is investigating an issue affecting IPv6 connectivity in FRA1, and a small subset of users in AMS2. At this time, users may experience issues connecting to IPv6-enabled resources.

        We apologize for the inconvenience and will share an update once we have more information.

        Our Engineering team has identified the issue and are implementing a fix. Our team has resolved the IPv6 connectivity issue in FRA1 and are monitoring the situation.

        In addition, it was discovered that the NYC1, and SFO2 regions were affected by this issue as well, and our team is currently working to resolve the issue in those regions. To summarize, users in the regions of AMS2, SGP1, NYC1, and SFO2 may still experience connection issues via IPv6.

        We are rapidly working on a fix. We will share more information once available.
