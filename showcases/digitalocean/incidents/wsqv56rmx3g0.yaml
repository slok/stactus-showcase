      description: |-
        Our Engineering team identified and resolved an issue with creation of Snapshots and Backups in the NYC3 region.

        From 20:11 UTC to 21:04 UTC, users may have experienced errors while taking Snapshots of Droplets in NYC3. Backup creation was also failing, however, Backups will be retried automatically.

        Our Engineering team quickly identified the root cause of the incident to be related to capacity on internal storage clusters and were able to rebalance capacity, allowing creations to succeed.

        We apologize for the disruption. If you continue to experience any issues, please open a Support ticket from within your account.
      resolved: true
