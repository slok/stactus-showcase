        Our Engineering Team is currently investigating an issue where some customers are unable to view their GenAI platform agent in the console. As a result, they are also unable to update their agent via the console. We are working to determine which types of agents are affected, including whether newly created agents are impacted.

        We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide another update as soon as possible.
