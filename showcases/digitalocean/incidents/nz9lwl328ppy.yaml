        Our Engineering team is investigating an issue related to our ongoing SFO3 maintenance here: https://status.digitalocean.com/incidents/4kj7krrpyg3k

        From 20:23 - 20:25 UTC, some services were impacted by a drop in networking. During that time, some Managed Kubernetes clusters experienced errors from the Kubernetes API and/or an increase in 5xx errors. Communication between other services and Block Storage Volumes may have been impacted as well.

        The impact has been mitigated and services should be working normally at this time.

        If you continue to experience problems, please open a ticket with our support team. We apologize for any inconvenience.
      resolved: true
