        Our Engineering team is currently investigating an issue impacting recently created Managed Kubernetes nodes not being able to connect to Droplets that utilize the Managed Kubernetes Cluster source to allow traffic.

        Users adding a Managed Kubernetes Cluster as a source in the Cloud firewall may see related Droplets not added to the Cloud firewall.

        As a workaround users can add the tag "k8s:CLUSTER_UUID" where "CLUSTER_UUID" is the user's Clusters UUID.
        Users can find the UUID details in the Cloud Panel URL of Managed Kubernetes Cluster or by using the command "doctl kubernetes cluster list"

        We apologize for the inconvenience and will share more information as soon as it's available.

        Our Engineering team has identified the cause of the issue affecting recently created Managed Kubernetes nodes. These nodes are currently unable to connect to Droplets that use the Managed Kubernetes Cluster as a source to allow traffic.
        Additionally, users who add a Managed Kubernetes Cluster as a source in the Cloud firewall may experience issues with related Droplets not being added to the firewall as expected.

        As a temporary solution, users can continue to add the tag k8s:CLUSTER_UUID, where CLUSTER_UUID is the UUID of the user's Managed Kubernetes Cluster. The UUID can be found in the Cloud Panel URL of the Managed Kubernetes Cluster or by running the following command:

        doctl kubernetes cluster list

        We are working on a solution and will provide further updates as we progress. We appreciate your patience and understanding.
