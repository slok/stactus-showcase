      description: |-
        Our Engineering team is currently investigating an issue impacting recently created Managed Kubernetes nodes not being able to connect to Droplets that utilize the Managed Kubernetes Cluster source to allow traffic.

        Users adding a Managed Kubernetes Cluster as a source in the Cloud firewall may see related Droplets not added to the Cloud firewall.

        As a workaround users can add the tag "k8s:CLUSTER_UUID" where "CLUSTER_UUID" is the user's Clusters UUID.
        Users can find the UUID details in the Cloud Panel URL of Managed Kubernetes Cluster or by using the command "doctl kubernetes cluster list"

        We apologize for the inconvenience and will share more information as soon as it's available.
      investigating: true
