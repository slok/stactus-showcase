        Our Engineering team is investigating an issue with resizing Droplet-attached Block Storage Volumes in all regions. Beginning at 17:04 UTC, users may not see the option to resize the Volume via the Cloud Control Panel, as well as see errors when attempting to resize attached Volumes via the API.

        At this time, unattached Volumes are able to be resized correctly.

        We will post an update once further information is available.
