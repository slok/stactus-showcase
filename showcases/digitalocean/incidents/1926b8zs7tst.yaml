        Our Engineering team is investigating an issue with the Managed Database clusters which is causing forks, restores and new creates to fail. The Mongo clusters are unaffected and should be operating normally.

        Our team is currently assessing the root cause and working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

        We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will share an update as soon as we have more information.

        During our investigation, we identified that operations triggering node rotation, such as upgrades, resizes, forking and ad-hoc maintenance patches, may cause issues connecting to the cluster.

        To prevent potential downtime, we recommend avoiding these operations until the issue is fully resolved.

        We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience as we work to address the situation.
