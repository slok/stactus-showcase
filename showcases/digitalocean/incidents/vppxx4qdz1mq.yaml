        Our Engineering team has identified and resolved an issue that impacted the ability to resize Droplets via both the API and UI from 18:15 until 21:55 UTC. During this time, users might have experienced errors when attempting to resize their Droplets through the API or the UI.

        Additionally, in an effort to resolve the issue with resizes, a secondary issue affected all event processing and some API calls for Droplets and related services from 21:50 until 22:00 UTC.

        Swift action was taken by our Engineering team to restore full functionality, and now everything is operating normally.

        We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. If you have any questions or continue to experience issues, please reach out via a Support ticket on your account.
