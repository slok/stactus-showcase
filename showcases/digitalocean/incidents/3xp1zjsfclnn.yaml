        Our Engineering team has identified several issues impacting indexing jobs and knowledge base creation.

        At this time, users may experience the following:

        - Indexing jobs are currently failing to start. As a result, most teams will be unable to initiate new jobs.
        - For teams where jobs do start, they may remain stuck in a "queued" status.
        - Knowledge base creation is still failing and may result in an error.

        We apologize for the disruption and will provide further updates as we learn more.
