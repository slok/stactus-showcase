        Our Engineering team has identified the root cause of the issue affecting the creation of Managed Database Clusters and is actively working on a fix.

        Users who already have a Caching Database Cluster in their account should be able to create a new Cluster. During this time, users without an existing caching cluster in their account may still see an error while creating a new cluster.

        We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide another update as soon as possible.
