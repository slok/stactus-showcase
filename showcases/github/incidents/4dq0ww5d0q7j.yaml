      description: At approximately 19:20 UTC on July 1st, 2024, one of GitHubâ€™s peering links to a public cloud provider began experiencing 5 - 20% packet loss. This resulted in intermittent network timeouts running Git operations for customers who run their own environments with that specific provider.<br /><br />Investigation pointed to an issue with the physical link. At 01:14 UTC we rerouted traffic away from the problematic link to other connections to resolve the incident. <br />
      resolved: true
