      description: From Jan 31, 2026 00:30 UTC to Feb 2, 2026 18:00 UTC Dependabot service was degraded and failed to create 10% of Automated Pull Requests. This was due to a cluster failover that connected to a read-only database.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by pausing Dependabot queues until traffic was properly routed to healthy clusters. We’re working on identifying and rerunning all failed jobs during this time.<br /><br />We’re adding new monitors and alerts to reduce our time to detection and prevent this in the future.
      resolved: true
