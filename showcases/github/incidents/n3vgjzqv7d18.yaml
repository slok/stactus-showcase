      description: Customers are not seeing repositories they expect to see in search results. We have restored a snapshot of this search index from Fri 12 Sep at 21:00 UTC. Changes made since then will be unavailable while we work to backfill the rest of the search index. Any new changes will be available in near-real time as expected.
