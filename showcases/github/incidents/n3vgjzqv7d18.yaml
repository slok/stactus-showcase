      description: Customers are not seeing repositories they expect to see in search results. We have restored a snapshot of this search index from Fri 12 Sep at 21:00 UTC. Changes made since then will be unavailable while we work to backfill the rest of the search index. Any new changes will be available in near-real time as expected.

      description: Most searchable repositories should again be visible in search results. Up to 1.5% of repositories may still be missing from search results.<br /><br />Many different actions synchronize the repository state with the search index, so we expect natural recovery for repositories that see more frequent user and API-driven interactions. <br /><br />A complete index reconciliation is underway to restore stagnant repositories that were deleted from the index. We will update again once we have a clear timeline of when we expect full recovery for those missing search results.
