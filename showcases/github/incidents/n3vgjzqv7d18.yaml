      description: Customers are not seeing repositories they expect to see in search results. We have restored a snapshot of this search index from Fri 12 Sep at 21:00 UTC. Changes made since then will be unavailable while we work to backfill the rest of the search index. Any new changes will be available in near-real time as expected.

      description: Most searchable repositories should again be visible in search results. Up to 1.5% of repositories may still be missing from search results.<br /><br />Many different actions synchronize the repository state with the search index, so we expect natural recovery for repositories that see more frequent user and API-driven interactions. <br /><br />A complete index reconciliation is underway to restore stagnant repositories that were deleted from the index. We will update again once we have a clear timeline of when we expect full recovery for those missing search results.

      description: 'At around 18:45 UTC on Friday, September 12, 2025, a change was deployed that unintentionally affected search index management. As a result, approximately 25% of repositories were temporarily missing from search results.<br /><br />By 12:45 UTC on Saturday, September 14, most missing repositories were restored from an earlier search index snapshot, and repositories updated between the snapshot and the restoration were reindexed. This backfill was completed at 21:25 UTC.<br /><br />After these repairs, about 98.5% of repositories were once again searchable. We are performing a full reconciliation of the search index and customers can expect to see records being updated and content becoming searchable for all repos again between now and Sept 25.<br /><br />NOTE: Users who notice missing or outdated repositories in search results can force reindexing by starring or un-starring the repository. Other repository actions such as adding topics, or updating the repository description, will also result in reindexing. In general, changes to searchable artifacts in GitHub will also update their respective search index in near-real time.<br /><br />User impact has been mitigated with the exception of the 1.5% of repos that are missing from the search index. The change responsible for the search issue has been reverted, and full reconciliation of the search index is underway, expected to complete by September 23. We have added additional checks to our indexing model to ensure this failure does not happen again. We are also investigating faster repair alternatives.<br /><br />To avoid resource contention and possible further issues we are currently not repairing repositories or organizations individually at this time. No repository data was lost, and other search types were not affected.'
