      description: On July 11, 2024, between 10:20 UTC and 14:00 UTC Copilot Chat was degraded and experienced intermittent timeouts. This only impacted requests routed to one of our service region providers. The error rate peaked at 10% for all requests and 9% of users. This was due to host upgrades in an upstream service provider. While this was a planned event, processes and tooling was not in place to anticipate and mitigate this downtime. <br /><br /><br />We are working to improve our processes and tooling for future planned events and escalation paths with our upstream providers.<br />
