      description: We've applied a mitigation to unblock running Actions. A regression occurred for Windows runners in public repositories which caused Actions workflows to fail. A mitigation is in place and customers should expect to see resolution soon.<br /><br />If you have a failing Actions workflow on a Windows runner, please retry and it is likely to work.

      description: Rollback has been completed, but we are still seeing failures on about 11% of GitHub Actions runs on 4 Core Windows runners in public repositories.<br /><br />If your workflow fails to start, try re-running and it is likely to work a second time.

      description: 'On Jan 26, 2026, from approximately 14:03 UTC to 23:42 UTC, GitHub Actions experienced job failures on some Windows standard hosted runners. This was caused by a configuration difference in a new Windows runner type that caused the expected D: drive to be missing. About 2.5% of all Windows standard runners jobs were impacted. Re-run of failed workflows had a high chance of succeeding given the limited rollout of the change.<br /><br />The job failures were mitigated by rolling back the affected configuration and removing the provisioned runners that had this configuration. To reduce the chance of recurrence, we are expanding runner telemetry and improving validation of runner configuration changes. We are also evaluating options to accelerate the mitigation time of any similar future events.'
