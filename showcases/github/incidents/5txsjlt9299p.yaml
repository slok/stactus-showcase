      description: From Feb 12, 2026 09:16:00 UTC to Feb 12, 2026 11:01 UTC, users attempting to download repository archives (tar.gz/zip) that include Git LFS objects received errors. Standard repository archives without LFS objects were not affected. On average, the archive download error rate was 0.0042% and peaked at 0.0339% of requests to the service. This was caused by deploying a corrupt configuration bundle, resulting in missing data used for network interface connections by the service.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by applying the correct configuration to each site. We have added checks for corruption in this deployment, and will add auto-rollback detection for this service to prevent issues like this in the future.
