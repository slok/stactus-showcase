      description: 'On April 28th, 2025, between 4AM and 11AM UTC, ~0.5% of customers experienced HTTP 500 or 429 responses for raw file access (via the GitHub website and APIs). Additionally, ~0.5% of customers may have seen slow pull request page loads and increased timeouts in the GraphQL API. <br /><br />The incident was caused by queueing in serving systems due to a change in traffic patterns, specifically scraping activity targeting our API. We have adjusted limits and added flow control to systems in response to the changing traffic patterns to improve our ability to prevent future large queueing issues. Weâ€™ve additionally updated rate limiting unauthenticated requests to reduce overall load, more details are here:  <br />https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-08-updated-rate-limits-for-unauthenticated-requests/'
