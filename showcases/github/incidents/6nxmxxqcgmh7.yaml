      description: On June 10, 2025, between 12:15 UTC and 19:04 UTC, Codespaces billing data processing experienced delays due to capacity issues in our worker pool. Approximately 57% of codespaces were affected during this incident, during which some customers may have observed incomplete or delayed billing usage information in their dashboards and usage reports, and may not have received timely notifications about approaching usage or spending limits. <br /><br />The incident was caused by an increase in the number of jobs in our worker pool without a corresponding increase in capacity, resulting in a backlog of unprocessed Codespaces billing jobs. <br /><br />We mitigated the issue by scaling up worker capacity, allowing the backlog to clear and billing data to catch up. We started seeing recovery immediately at 17:40 UTC and were fully caught up by 19:04 UTC.<br /><br />To prevent recurrence, we are moving critical billing jobs into a dedicated worker pool monitored by the Codespaces team, and are reviewing alerting thresholds to ensure more rapid detection and mitigation of delays in the future.
