      description: On Oct 24 2024 at 06:55 UTC, a syntactically correct, but invalid discussion template YAML config file was committed in the community/community repository. This caused all users of that repository who tried to access a discussion template or attempted to create a discussion to receive a 500 error response.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by manually reverting the invalid template changes.<br /><br />We are adding support to detect and prevent invalid discussion template YAML from causing user-facing errors in the future.
