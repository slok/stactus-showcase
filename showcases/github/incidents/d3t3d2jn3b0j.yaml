      description: Between 2025-03-27 12:00 UTC and 2025-04-03 16:00 UTC, the GitHub Enterprise Cloud Dormant Users report was degraded and falsely indicated that dormant users were active within their business. This was due to increased load on a database from a non-performant query.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by increasing the capacity of the database, and installing monitors for this specific report to improve observability for future. As a long-term solution, we are rewriting the Dormant Users report to optimize how it queries for user activity, which will result in significantly faster and accurate report generation.
