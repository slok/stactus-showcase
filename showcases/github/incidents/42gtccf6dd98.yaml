      description: On May 8, 2025, between 14:40 UTC and 16:27 UTC the Git Operations service was degraded causing some pushes and merges to fail. On average, the error rate was 1.4% with a peak error rate of 2.24%. This was due to a configuration change which unexpectedly led a critical service to shut down on a subset of hosts that store repository data.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by re-deploying the affected service to restore its functionality.<br /><br />In order to prevent similar incidents from happening again, we identified the cause that triggered this behavior and mitigated it for future deployments. Additionally, to reduce time to detection we will improve monitoring of the impacted service.
