      description: Between June 18th, 2024 at 09:34 PM UTC and June 19th, 2024 at 12:53 PM the Copilot Pull Request Summaries Service was unavailable. This was due to an internal change in access approach from the Copilot Pull Request service to the Copilot API.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting the change in access which immediately resolved the errors.<br /><br />We are working to improve our monitoring in this area and reduce our time to detection to more quickly address issues like this one in the future.<br />
