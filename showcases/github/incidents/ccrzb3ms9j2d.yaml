      description: We're experiencing delays in search indexing for Issues and Pull Requests. Search results may show data up to three minutes old due to elevated processing times in our indexing pipeline. We're working to restore normal performance. We'll post another update by 10:30 UTC.

      description: On December 23, 2025, between 09:15 UTC and 10:32 UTC the Issues and Pull Requests search indexing service was degraded and caused search results to contain stale data up to 3 minutes old for roughly 1.3 million issues and pull requests. This was due to search indexing queues backing up from resource contention caused by a running transition.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by cancelling the running transition.<br /><br />We are working to implement closer monitoring of search infrastructure resource utilization during transitions to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.
