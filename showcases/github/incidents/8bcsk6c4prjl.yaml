      description: We are seeing delays processing the AI Session event queue, which is causing sessions to not be displayed on the AI Controls UI. We have deployed a fix to improve the queue processing and are monitoring for effectiveness. We continue to investigate other mitigation paths.

      description: We have deployed an additional fix and are beginning to see recovery to the queue preventing AI Sessions from showing in the AI Controls UI. We are working on an estimate for when the queue will be fully processed, and will post another update once we have that information.
      investigating: true

      description: We estimate the backlogged queue will take 3 hours to process. We will post another update once it is completed, or if anything changes with the recovery process.

      description: From January 5, 2026, 00:00 UTC to January 10, 2026, 02:30 UTC, customers using the AI Controls public preview feature experienced delays in viewing Copilot agent session data. Newly created sessions took progressively longer to appear, initially hours, then eventually exceeding 24 hours. Since the page displays only the most recent 24 hours of activity, once processing delays exceeded this threshold, no recent data was visible. Session data remained available in audit logs throughout the incident.<br /><br />Inefficient database queries in the data processing pipeline caused significant processing latency, creating a multi-day backlog. As the backlog grew, the delay between when sessions occurred and when they appeared on the page increased, eventually exceeding the 24-hour display window.<br /><br />The issue was resolved on January 10, 2026, 02:30 UTC, after query optimizations and a database index were deployed. We are implementing enhanced monitoring and automated testing to detect inefficient queries before deployment to prevent recurrence.
