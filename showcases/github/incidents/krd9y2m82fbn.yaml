      description: We are seeing increased error rates with Codespaces generally. This is due to a third party provider experiencing problems. This impacts both creation of new Codespaces and resumption of existing ones.<br /><br />We continue to monitor and will report with more details as we have them.

      description: On October 20, 2025, between 08:05 UTC and 10:50 UTC the Codespaces service was degraded, with users experiencing failures creating new codespaces and resuming existing ones. On average, the error rate for codespace creation was 39.5% and peaked at 71% of requests to the service during the incident window. Resume operations averaged 23.4% error rate with a peak of 46%. This was due to a cascading failure triggered by an outage in a 3rd-party dependency required to build devcontainer images.<br /><br />The impact was mitigated when the 3rd-party dependency recovered.<br /><br />We are investigating opportunities to make this dependency not a critical path for our container build process and working to improve our monitoring and alerting systems to reduce our time to detection of issues like this one in the future.
