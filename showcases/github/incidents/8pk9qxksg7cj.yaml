      description: On July 16, 2025, between 05:20 UTC and 08:30 UTC, the Copilot service experienced degraded availability for Claude 3.7 requests. Around 10% of Claude 3.7 requests failed during this time. The issue was caused by an upstream problem affecting our ability to serve requests.<br />We mitigated by rerouting capacity and monitoring recovery. We are improving detection and mitigation to reduce future impact.
