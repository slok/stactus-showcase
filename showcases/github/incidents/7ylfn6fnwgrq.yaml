      description: On February 11 between 16:37 UTC and 00:59 UTC the following day, 4.7% of workflows running on GitHub Larger Hosted Runners were delayed by an average of 37 minutes. Standard Hosted and self-hosted runners were not impacted. <br /><br />This incident was caused by capacity degradation in Central US for Larger Hosted Runners. Workloads not pinned to that region were picked up by other regions, but were delayed as those regions became saturated. Workloads configured with private networking in that region were delayed until compute capacity in that region recovered. The issue was mitigated by rebalancing capacity across internal and external workloads and general increases in capacity in affected regions to speed recovery. <br /><br />In addition to working with our compute partners on the core capacity degradation, we are working to ensure other regions are better able to absorb load with less delay to customer workloads. For pinned workflows using private networking, we are shipping support soon for customers to failover if private networking is configured in a paired region.
