      description: On February 3, 2026, between 09:35 UTC and 10:15 UTC, GitHub Copilot experienced elevated error rates, with an average of 4% of requests failing.<br /><br />This was caused by a capacity imbalance that led to resource exhaustion on backend services. The incident was resolved by infrastructure rebalancing, and we subsequently deployed additional capacity.<br /><br />We are improving observability to detect capacity imbalances earlier and enhancing our infrastructure to better handle traffic spikes.
      resolved: true
