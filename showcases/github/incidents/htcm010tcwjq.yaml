      description: On November 11, 2025, between 16:28 UTC and 20:54 UTC, GitHub Actions larger hosted runners experienced degraded performance, with 0.4% of overall workflow runs and 8.8% of larger hosted runner jobs failing to start within 5 minutes. The majority of impact was mitigated by 18:44, with a small tail of organizations taking longer to recover.<br /><br />The impact was caused by the same database infrastructure issue that caused similar larger hosted runner performance degradation on October 23rd, 2025.  In this case, it was triggered by a brief infrastructure event in this incident rather than a database change.<br /><br />Through this incident, we identified and implemented a better solution for both prevention and faster mitigation. In addition to this, a durable solution for the underlying database issue is rolling out soon.
