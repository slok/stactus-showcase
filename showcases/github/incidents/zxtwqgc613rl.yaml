      description: Some customers are continuing to see intermittent connection failures to their codespaces. We are monitoring closely to build a better idea of when impact should be mitigated. At this time, we expect the number of impacted users to remain low, and will update again when there is a development in our repair efforts.

      description: On February 15, 2025, between 6:35 pm UTC and 4:15 am UTC the Codespaces service was degraded and users in various regions experienced intermittent connection failures. On average, the error rate was 50% and peaked at 65% of requests to the service. This was due to a service deployment.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by completing the deployment to the impacted regions.<br /><br />The completion of this deployment should prevent future deployments of the service from negatively impacting Codespace connectivity.
