      description: On October 30th we shipped a change that broke 3 links in the "Solutions" dropdown of the marketing navigation seen on https://github.com/home. We noticed internally the broken links and declared an incident so our users would know no other functionality was impacted. We were able to revert a change and are evaluating our testing and rollout processes to prevent future incidents like these.
