      description: On July 13, 2024 between 00:01 and 19:27 UTC the Copilot service was degraded. During this time period, Copilot code completions error rate peaked at 1.16% and Copilot Chat error rate peaked at 63%. Between 01:00 and 02:00 UTC we were able to reroute traffic for Chat to bring error rates below 6%. During the time of impact customers would have seen delayed responses, errors, or timeouts during requests. GitHub code scanning autofix jobs were also delayed during this incident. <br /><br />A resource cleanup job was scheduled by <a href="https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status/history?trackingid=4L44-3F0">Azure OpenAI (AOAI) service early July 13th</a> targeting a resource group thought to only contain unused resources. This resource group unintentionally contained critical, still in use, resources that were then removed. The cleanup job was halted before removing all resources in the resource group. Enough resources remained that GitHub was able to mitigate while resources were reconstructed.<br /><br />We are working with AOAI to ensure mitigation is in place to prevent future impact. In addition, we will improve traffic rerouting processes to reduce time to mitigate in the future.
