      description: On August 27, 2025 between 20:35 and 21:17 UTC, Copilot, Web and REST API traffic experienced degraded performance. Copilot saw an average of 36% of requests fail with a peak failure rate of 77%. Approximately 2% of all non-Copilot Web and REST API traffic requests failed.<br /><br />This incident occurred after a stale schema cache was used following a database migration. This led to a large number of failed queries. At 21:15 UTC, we applied a fix and by 21:17 UTC, all services had fully recovered.<br /><br />We have implemented a block for this failure mode as an immediate solution and are actively working to add safeguards to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
