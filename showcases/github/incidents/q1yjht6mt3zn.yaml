      description: Between July 24th, 2024 at 15:17 UTC and July 25th, 2024 at 21:04 UTC, the external identities service was degraded and prevented customers from linking teams to external groups on the create/edit team page. Team creation and team edits would appear to function as normal, but the selected group would not be linked to the team after form submission. This was due to a bug in the Primer experimental SelectPanel component that was mistakenly rolled out to customers via a feature flag.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by scaling the feature flag back down to 0% of actors.<br /><br />We are making improvements to our release process and test coverage to avoid similar incidents in the future.
