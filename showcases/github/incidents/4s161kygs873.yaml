      description: On July 23, 2024, between 21:40 UTC and 22:00 UTC, Copilot Chat experienced errors and service degradation. During this time, the global error rate peaked at 20% of Chat requests.<br /><br />This was due to a faulty deployment in a service provider that caused server errors from a single region. Traffic was routed away from this region at 22:00 UTC which restored functionality while the upstream service provider rolled back their change. The rollback was completed at 22:38 UTC.<br /><br />We are working to improve our ability to respond more quickly to similar issues through faster regional redirection and working with our upstream provider on improved monitoring.<br />
      resolved: true
