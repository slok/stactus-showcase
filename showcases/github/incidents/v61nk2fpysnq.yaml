      description: On October 21, 2025, between 13:30 and 17:30 UTC, GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organization SAML Single Sign-On experienced degraded performance. Customers may have been unable to successfully authenticate into their GitHub Organizations during this period. Organization SAML recorded a maximum of 0.4% of SSO requests failing during this timeframe.<br /><br />This incident stemmed from a failure in a read replica database partition responsible for storing license usage information for GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organizations. This partition failure resulted in users from affected organizations, whose license usage information was stored on this partition, being unable to access SSO during the aforementioned window. A successful SSO requires an available license for the user who is accessing a GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organization backed by SSO.<br />The failing partition was subsequently taken out of service, thereby mitigating the issue. <br /><br />Remedial actions are currently underway to ensure that a read replica failure does not compromise the overall service availability.<br />
