Our systems maintained data continuity and we experienced no data loss. There was no impact to the Audit Log API or the Audit Log user interface. Any configured Audit Log Streaming endpoints received all relevant Audit Log Events (but they were delayed) and normal service was restored after the incident's resolution.
