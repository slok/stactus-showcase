      description: We are experiencing degraded availability for the Gemini 2.5 Pro model in Copilot Chat, VS Code and other Copilot products. This is due to an issue with an upstream model provider. We are working with them to resolve the issue.<br /><br />Other models are available and working as expected.

      description: Between May 14, 2025 14:16 UTC and May 15, 2025 01:02 UTC the Copilot service was degraded and returned a high volume of internal server errors for requests targeting Gemini 2.5 Pro, a public preview model. On average, the error rate for Gemini 2.5 Pro was 19.6% and peaked at 41%. This was due to a high volume of internal server errors and rate limiting by the upstream model provider.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by temporarily disabling Gemini 2.5 Pro for all Copilot Chat experiences, and then worked with the model provider to ensure model health was sufficiently improved before re-enabling.<br /><br />We are working with partners to improve communication speed and are planning to move to more resilient infrastructure to mitigate issues like this one in the future.
