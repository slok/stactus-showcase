      description: On 7/3/2025, between 5:21:17 AM and 7:11:49 AM UTC, customers were prevented from SSO authorizing Personal Access Tokens and SSH keys via the GitHub UI. Approximately 1300 users were impacted.<br /><br />A code change modified the content type of the response returned by the server, causing a lazily-loaded dropdown to fail to render, prohibiting the user from proceeding to authorize. No authorization systems were impacted during the incident, only the UI component. We mitigated the incident by reverting the code change that introduced the problem.<br /><br />We are making improvements to our release process and test coverage to catch this class of error earlier in our deployment pipeline. Further, we are improving monitoring to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.<br />
