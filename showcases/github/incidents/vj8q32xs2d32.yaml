      description: From Feb 2, 2026 17:13 UTC to Feb 2, 2026 17:36 UTC we experienced failures on ~0.02% of Git operations. While deploying an internal service, a misconfiguration caused a small subset of traffic to route to a service that was not ready. During the incident we observed the degradation and statused publicly.<br /><br />To mitigate the issue, traffic was redirected to healthy instances and we resumed normal operation.<br /><br />We are improving our monitoring and deployment processes in this area to avoid future routing issues.
