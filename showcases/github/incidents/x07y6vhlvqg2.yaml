      description: |-
        Between Thursday 13th, 2025 19:30 UTC and Friday 14th, 2025 08:02 UTC the Migrations service was experiencing intermittent migration failures for some customers. This was caused by a code change that contained an edge case that erroneously failed some migrations.

        We mitigated the incident by rolling back the code change.

        We are working on improving our monitoring and deployment practices to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.
