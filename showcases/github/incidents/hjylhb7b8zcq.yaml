      description: On May 15, 2025, between 00:08 AM UTC and 10:21 AM UTC, customers were unable to create fine-grained Personal Access Tokens (PATs) on github.com. This incident was triggered by a recent code change to our front end that unintentionally affected the way certain pages loaded and prevented the PAT creation process from completing.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting the problematic change. To reduce the likelihood of similar issues in the future, we are improving our monitoring for page load anomalies and PAT creation failures and improving our safe deployment practices.
