        On 15 July, between 19:55 and 19:58 UTC, requests to GitHub had a high failure rate while successful requests suffered up to 10x expected latency.

        Browser-based requests saw a failure rate of up to 20%, GraphQL had up to a 9% failure rate and 2% of REST API requests failed. Any downstream service dependent on GitHub APIs was also affected during this short window.

        The failure stemmed from a database query change, and was rolled back by our deployment tooling which automatically detected the issue. We will continue to invest in automated detection and rollback with a goal of minimizing time to recovery.
      resolved: true
