      description: On January 14, 2025, between 19:13 UTC and 21:210 UTC the Codespaces service was degraded and led to connection failures with running codespaces, with a 7.6% failure rate for connections during the degradation. Users with bad connections could not use impacted codespaces until they were stopped and restarted.<br /><br />This was caused by bad connections left behind after a deployment in an upstream dependency that the Codespaces service still provided to clients. The incident self-mitigated as new connections replaced stale ones. We are coordinating to ensure connection stability with future deployments of this nature.
