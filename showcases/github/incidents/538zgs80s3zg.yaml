      description: Between June 27th, 2024 at 20:39 UTC and 21:37 UTC the Migrations service was unable to process migrations. This was due to a invalid infrastructure credential. <br /><br />We mitigated the issue by updating the credential and deploying the service. <br /><br />Mechanisms and automation will be implemented to detect and prevent this issue again in the future.
