      description: We are continuing to investigate delays to status updates to Actions Workflow Runs, Workflow Job Runs, and Check Steps. Customers may see that their Actions workflows have completed, but the run appears to be waiting for its status to update. We will continue providing updates on the progress towards mitigation.

      description: On October 30, 2024, between 5:45 and 9:42 UTC, the Actions service was degraded, causing run delays. On average, Actions workflow run, job, and step updates were delayed as much as one hour. The delays were caused by updates in a dependent service that led to failures in Redis connectivity. Delays recovered once the Redis cluster connectivity was restored at 8:16 UTC. The incident was fully mitigated once the job queue had processed by 9:24 UTC. This incident followed an earlier short period of impact on hosted runners due to a similar issue, which was mitigated by failing over to a healthy cluster.<br /><br />From this, we are working to improve our observability across Redis clusters to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future where multiple clusters and services were impacted.  We will also be working to reduce the time to mitigate and improve general resilience to this dependency.
