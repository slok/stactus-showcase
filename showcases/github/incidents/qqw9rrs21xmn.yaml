      description: On July 8th, 2024, between 18:18 UTC and 19:11 UTC, various services relying on static assets were degraded, including user uploaded content on github.com, access to docs.github.com and Pages sites, and downloads of Release assets and Packages. <br /><br />The outage primarily affected users in the vicinity of New York City, USA, due to a local CDN disruption. <br /><br />Service was restored without our intervention.<br /><br />We are working to improve our external monitoring, which failed to detect the issue and will be evaluating a backup mechanism to keep critical services available, such as being able to load assets on GitHub.com, in the event of an outage with our CDN.<br />
