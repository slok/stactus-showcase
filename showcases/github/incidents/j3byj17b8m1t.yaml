      description: On July 21, 2025, between 07:20 UTC and 08:00 UTC, the Copilot service experienced degraded availability for Claude 4 requests. 2% of Claude 4 requests failed during this time. The issue was caused by an upstream problem affecting our ability to serve requests.<br />We mitigated by rerouting capacity and monitoring recovery. We are improving detection and mitigation to reduce future impact.
