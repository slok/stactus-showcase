On average, 4% of the requests to this model failed due to an issue with our upstream provider. No other models were impacted.<br /><br />The issue was resolved after the upstream provider fixed the problem that caused the disruption. GitHub will continue to enhance our monitoring and alerting systems to reduce the time it takes to detect and mitigate similar issues in the future.
