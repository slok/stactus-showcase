        Between 10:00 and 20:00 UTC on May 27, a change to our git proxy service resulted in some git client implementations not being able to consistently push to GitHub.  Reverting the change resulted in an immediate resolution of the problem for all customers. The inflated time to detect this failure was due to the relatively few impacted clients. We are re-evaluating the proposed change to understand how we can
        prevent and detect such failures in the future.
      resolved: true
