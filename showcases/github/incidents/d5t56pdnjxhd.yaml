        On December 31, 2025, between 04:00 UTC and 22:31 UTC, all users visiting https://github.com/features/copilot were unable to load the page and were instead redirected to an error page.
        The issue was caused by an unexpected content change that resulted in page rendering errors.
        We mitigated the incident by reverting the change, which restored normal page behavior.
        To reduce the likelihood and duration of similar issues in the future, we are improving monitoring and alerting for increased error rates on this page and similar pages, and strengthening validation and safeguards around content updates to prevent unexpected changes from causing user-facing errors.
      resolved: true
