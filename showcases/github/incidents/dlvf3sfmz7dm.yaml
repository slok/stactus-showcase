      description: On October 22, 2025, between 14:06 UTC and 15:17 UTC, less than 0.5% of web users experienced intermittent slow page loads on GitHub.com. During this time, API requests showed increased latency, with up to 2% timing out.  <br /><br />The issue was caused by elevated loads on one of our databases caused by a poorly performing query, which impacted performance for a subset of requests.<br /><br />We identified the source of the load and optimized the query to restore normal performance. Weâ€™ve added monitors for early detection for query performance, and we continue to monitor the system closely to ensure ongoing stability. <br />
