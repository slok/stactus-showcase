      description: On June 10, 2025, between 14:28 UTC and 14:45 UTC the pull request service experienced a period of degraded performance, resulting in merge error rates exceeding 1%. The root cause was an overloaded host in our Git infrastructure.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by removing this host from the actual set of valid replicas until the host was healthy again.<br /><br />We are working to improve the various mechanisms that are in place in our existing infrastructure to protect us from such problems, and we will be revisiting why in this particular scenario they didn't protect us as expected.
