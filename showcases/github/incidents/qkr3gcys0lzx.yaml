      description: 'On December 15, 2025, between 15:15 UTC and 18:22 UTC, Copilot Code Review experienced a service degradation that caused 46.97% of pull request review requests to fail, requiring users to re-request a review. Impacted users saw the error message: “Copilot encountered an error and was unable to review this pull request. You can try again by re-requesting a review.” The remaining requests completed successfully.<br /><br />The degradation was caused by elevated response times in an internal, model-backed dependency, which led to request timeouts and backpressure in the review processing pipeline, resulting in sustained queue growth and failed review completion.<br /><br />We mitigated the issue by temporarily bypassing fix suggestions to reduce latency, increasing worker capacity to drain the backlog, and rolling out a model configuration change that reduced end-to-end latency. Queue depth and request success rates returned to normal and remained stable through peak traffic.<br /><br />Following the incident, we increased baseline worker capacity, added instrumentation for worker utilization and queue health, and are improving automatic load-shedding, fallback behavior, and alerting to reduce time to detection and mitigation for similar issues.'
