      description: Between June 19th, 2025 11:35 UTC and June 20th, 2025 11:20 UTC the GitHub Mobile Android application was unable to login new users. The iOS app was unaffected.<br /><br />This was due to a new GitHub App feature being tested internally, which was inadvertently enforced for all GitHub-owned applications, including GitHub Mobile.<br /><br />A mismatch in client and server expectations due to this feature caused logins to fail. We mitigated the incident by disabling the feature flag controlling the feature.<br /><br />We are working to improve our time to detection and put in place stronger guardrails that reduce impact from internal testing on applications used by all customers.<br />
