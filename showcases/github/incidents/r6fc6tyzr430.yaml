      description: On November 26th, 2025, between approximately 02:24 UTC and December 8th, 2025 at 20:26 UTC, enterprise administrators experienced a disruption when viewing agent session activities in the Enterprise AI Controls page. During this period, users were unable to list agent session activity in the AI Controls view. This did not impact viewing agent session activity in audit logs or directly navigating to individual agent session logs, or otherwise managing AI Agents.<br /><br />The issue was caused by a misconfiguration in a change deployed on November 25th that unintentionally prevented data from being published to an internal Kafka topic responsible for feeding the AI Controls page with agent session activity information.<br /><br />The problem was identified and mitigated on December 8th by correcting the configuration issue. GitHub is improving monitoring for data pipeline dependencies and enhancing pre-deployment validation to catch configuration issues before they reach production.
