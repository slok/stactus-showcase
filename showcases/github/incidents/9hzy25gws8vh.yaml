      description: On May 27, 2025, between 09:31 UTC and 13:31 UTC, some Actions jobs experienced failures uploading to and downloading from the Actions Cache service. During the incident, 6% of all workflow runs couldn’t upload or download cache entries from the service, resulting in a non-blocking warning message in the logs and performance degradation. The disruption was caused by an infrastructure update related to the retirement of a legacy service, which unintentionally impacted Cache service availability. We resolved the incident by reverting the change and have since implemented a permanent fix to prevent recurrence.<br /><br />We are improving our configuration change processes by introducing additional end-to-end tests to cover the identified gaps, and implementing deployment pipeline improvements to reduce mitigation time for similar issues in the future.
