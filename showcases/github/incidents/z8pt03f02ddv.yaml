      description: We are experiencing degraded availability for the Claude 4 model in Copilot Chat, VS Code and other Copilot products. This is due to an issue with an upstream model provider. We are working with them to resolve the issue.<br /><br />Other models are available and working as expected. We recommend using Claude 3.7 as an alternative.

      description: On June 18, 2025 between 22:20 UTC and 23:00 UTC the Claude Sonnet 3.7 and Claude Sonnet 4 models for GitHub Copilot Chat experienced degraded performance. During the impact, some users would receive an immediate error when making a request to a Claude model. This was due to upstream errors with one of our model providers, which have since been resolved. We mitigated the impact by disabling the affected provider endpoints to reduce user impact, redirecting Claude Sonnet requests to additional partners.<br /><br />We are working to update our incident response playbooks for infrastructure provider outages and improve our monitoring and alerting systems to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.
