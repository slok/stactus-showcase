      description: We are experiencing degraded availability for the Claude 4 model in Copilot Chat, VS Code and other Copilot products. This is due to an issue with an upstream model provider. We are working with them to resolve the issue.<br /><br />Other models are available and working as expected. We recommend using Claude 3.7 as an alternative.
