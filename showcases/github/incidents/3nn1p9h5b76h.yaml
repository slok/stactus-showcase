      description: On May 16th, 2025, between 08:42:00 UTC and 12:26:00 UTC, the data store powering the Audit Log API service experienced elevated latency resulting in higher error rates due to timeouts. About 3.8%  of Audit Log API queries for Git events experienced timeouts. The data store team deployed mitigating actions which resulted in a full recovery of the data storeâ€™s availability.
