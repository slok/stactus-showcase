      description: On September 29, 2025, between 17:53 and 18:42 UTC, the Copilot service experienced a degradation of the Gemini 2.5 model due to an issue with our upstream provider. Approximately 24% of requests failed, affecting 56% of users during this period. No other models were impacted.<br /><br />GitHub notified the upstream provider of the problem as soon as it was detected. The issue was resolved after the upstream provider rolled back a recent change that caused the disruption. GitHub will continue to enhance our monitoring and alerting systems to reduce the time it takes to detect and mitigate similar issues in the future.
