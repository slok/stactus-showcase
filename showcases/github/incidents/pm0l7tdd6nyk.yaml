      description: On September 23, 2025, between 15:29 UTC and 17:38 UTC and also on September 24, 2025 between 15:02 UTC and 15:12, email deliveries were delayed up to 50 minutes which resulted in significant delays for most types of email notifications. This occurred due to an unusually high volume of traffic which caused resource contention on some of our outbound email servers.<br /><br />We have updated the configuration we use to better allocate capacity when there is a high volume of traffic and are also updating our monitors so we can detect this type of issue before it becomes a customer impacting incident.
