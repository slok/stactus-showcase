        Beginning at 6:52 PM UTC on August 6, 2024 and lasting until 6:59 PM UTC, some customers of github.com saw errors when navigating to a Pull Request. The error rate peaked at ~5% for logged in users. This was due to a change which was rolled back after alerts fired during the deployment.

        We did not status before we completed the rollback, and the incident is currently resolved. We are sorry for the delayed post on githubstatus.com.
      resolved: true
