      description: We are seeing an increase in 429s when retrieving git artifacts from GitHub.com. This is manifesting in many ways, for example, in failed GitHub Actions workflow runs.<br /><br />We have our engineers working on mitigation and we will provide more information as we have it. Thank you for your patience.

      description: Public Summary Draft<br />Between July 28, 2025 16:31 UTC to July 29, 2025 12:05 UTC users saw degraded Git Operations for raw file downloads. On average, the error rate was .005%, with a peak error rate of 3.89%. This was due to a sustained increase in unauthenticated repository traffic.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by applying regional rate limiting, rolling back a service that was unable to scale with the additional traffic, and addressed a bug that impacted the caching of raw requests. Additionally, we horizontally scaled several dependencies of the service to appropriately handle the increase in traffic.<br /><br />We are working on improving our time to detection and have implemented controls to prevent similar incidents in future.
