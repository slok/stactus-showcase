      description: We are experiencing degraded availability for the Claude Haiku 4.5 model in Copilot Chat, VS Code and other Copilot products. This is due to an issue with an upstream model provider. We are working with them to resolve the issue.<br />Other models are available and working as expected.

      description: The issues with our upstream model provider have been resolved, and Claude Haiku 4.5 is once again available in Copilot Chat and across IDE integrations.<br /><br />We will continue monitoring to ensure stability, but mitigation is complete.

      description: On February 11, 2025, between 14:30 UTC and 15:30 UTC, the Copilot service experienced degraded availability for requests to Claude Haiku 4.5. During this time, on average 10% of requests failed with 23% of sessions impacted. The issue was caused by an upstream problem from multiple external model providers that affected our ability to serve requests. <br /><br />The incident was mitigated once one of the providers resolved the issue and we rerouted capacity fully to that provider. We have improved our telemetry to improve incident observability and implemented an automated retry mechanism for requests to this model to mitigate similar future upstream incidents.
