      description: Between November 5, 2025 23:27 UTC and November 6, 2025 00:06 UTC, ghost text requests experienced errors from upstream model providers. This was a continuation of the service disruption for which we statused Copilot earlier that day, although more limited in scope.<br /><br />During the service disruption, users were again automatically re-routed to healthy model hosts, minimizing impact to users and we are updating our monitors and failover mechanism to mitigate similar issues in the future.
      resolved: true
