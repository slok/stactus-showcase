      description: Between May 19th 3:40AM UTC and May 20th 5:40PM UTC the service responsible for rendering Jupyter notebooks was degraded. During this time customers were unable to render Jupyter Notebooks.<br /><br />This occurred due to an issue with a Redis dependency which was mitigated by restarting. An issue with our monitoring led to a delay in our response. We are working to improve the quality and accuracy of our monitors to reduce the time to detection.
