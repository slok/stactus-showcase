      description: Between 2026-01-16 16:17 and 2026-01-17 02:54 UTC, some Copilot Business users were unable to access and use certain Copilot features and models. This was due to a bug with how we determine if a user has access to a feature, inadvertently marking features and models as inaccessible for users whose enterprise(s) had not configured the policy.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting the problematic deployment. We are improving our internal monitoring and mitigation processes to reduce the risk and extended downtime of similar incidents in the future.<br />
