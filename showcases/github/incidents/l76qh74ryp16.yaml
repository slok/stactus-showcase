      description: On January 9, 2025, between 06:26 and 07:49 UTC, Actions experienced degraded performance, leading to failures in about 1% of workflow runs across ~10k repositories. The failures occurred due to an outage in a dependent service, which disrupted Redis connectivity in the East US 2 region. We mitigated the incident by re-routing Redis traffic out of that region at 07:49 UTC. We continued to monitor service recovery before resolving the incident at 08:30 UTC. We are working to improve our monitoring to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.
      resolved: true
