      description: From Nov 17, 2025 00:00 UTC to Nov 17, 2025 15:00 UTC Dependabot was hitting a rate limit in GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) and was unable to complete about 57% of jobs.<br /><br />To mitigate the issue we lowered the rate at which Dependabot started jobs and increased the GHCR rate limit.<br /><br />We’re adding new monitors and alerts and looking into more ways to decrease load on GHCR to help prevent this in the future.
