      description: Between November 17, 2025 21:24 UTC and November 18, 2025 00:04 UTC the gists service was degraded and users were unable to create gists via the web UI. 100% of gist creation requests failed with a 404 response. This was due to a change in the web middleware that inadvertently triggered a routing error. We resolved the incident by rolling back the change. We are working on more effective monitoring to reduce the time it takes to detect similar issues and evaluating our testing approach for middleware functionality.
