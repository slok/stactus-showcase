      description: Starting on June 18th from 4:59pm UTC to 6:06pm UTC, customer migrations were unavailable and failing. This impacted all in-progress migration during that time. This issue was due to an incorrect configuration on our Database cluster. We mitigated the issue by remediating the database configuration and are working with stakeholders to ensure safeguards are in place to prevent the issue going forward.
