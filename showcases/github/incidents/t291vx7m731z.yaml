      description: On September 29, 2025 between 16:26 UTC and 17:33 UTC the Copilot API experienced a partial degradation causing intermittent erroneous 404 responses for an average of 0.2% of GitHub MCP server requests, peaking at times around 2% of requests. The issue stemmed from an upgrade of an internal dependency which exposed a misconfiguration in the service.<br /><br />We resolved the incident by rolling back the upgrade to address the misconfiguration. We fixed the configuration issue and will improve documentation and rollout process to prevent similar issues.
      resolved: true
