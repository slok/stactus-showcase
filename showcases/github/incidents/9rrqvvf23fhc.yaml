      description: On July 18, 2024, from 22:37 UTC to 04:47 UTC, one of our provider's services experienced degradation, causing errors in Codespaces, particularly when starting the VSCode server and installing extensions. The error rate reached nearly 100%, resulting in a global outage of Codespaces. During this time, users worldwide were unable to connect to VSCode. However, other clients that do not rely on the VSCode server, such as GitHub CLI, remained functional.<br /><br />We are actively working to enhance our detection and mitigation processes to improve our response time to similar issues in the future. Additionally, we are exploring ways to operate Codespaces in a more degraded state when one of our providers encounters issues, to prevent a complete outage.
