      description: On July 30th, 2024, between 13:25 UTC and 18:15 UTC, customers using Larger Hosted Runners may have experienced extended queue times for jobs that depended on a Runner with VNet Injection enabled in a virtual network within the East US 2 region. Runners without VNet Injection or those with VNet Injection in other regions were not affected. The issue was caused due to an outage in a third party provider blocking a large percentage of VM allocations in the East US 2 region. Once the underlying issue with the third party provider was resolved, job queue times went back to normal. We are exploring the addition of support for customers to define VNet Injection Runners with VNets across multiple regions to minimize the impact of outages in a single region.
