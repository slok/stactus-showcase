      description: Between May 16, 2025, 1:21 PM UTC and May 17, 2025, 2:26 AM UTC, the GitHub Enterprise Importer service was degraded and experienced slow processing of customer migrations. Customers may have seen extended wait times for migrations to start or complete.<br /><br />This incident was initially observed as a slowdown in migration processing. During our investigation, we identified that a recent change aimed at improving API query performance caused an increase in load signals, which triggered migration throttling. As a result, the performance of migrations was negatively impacted, and overall migration duration increased. In parallel, we identified a race condition that caused a specific migration to be repeatedly re-queued, further straining system resources and contributing to a backlog of migration jobs, resulting in accumulated delays. No data was lost, and all migrations were ultimately processed successfully.<br /><br />We have reverted the feature flag associated with a query change and are working to improve system safeguards to help prevent similar race condition issues from occurring in the future.
