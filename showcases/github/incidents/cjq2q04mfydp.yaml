      description: On April 7, 2025 between 2:15:37 AM UTC and 2:31:14 AM UTC, multiple GitHub services were degraded. Requests to these services returned 5xx errors at a high rate due to an internal database being exhausted by our Codespaces service. The incident mitigated on its own.<br /><br />We have addressed the problematic queries from the Codespaces service, minimizing the risk of future reoccurrances.
