        On September 24th, 2025, between 08:02 UTC and 09:11 UTC the Copilot service was degraded for Claude Opus 4 and Claude Opus 4.1 requests. On average, 22% of requests failed for Claude Opus 4 and 80% of requests for Claude Opus 4.1. This was due to an upstream provider returning elevated errors on Claude Opus 4 and Opus 4.1.

        We mitigated the issue by directing users to select other models and by monitoring recovery. To resolve the issue, we are expanding failover capabilities by integrating with additional infrastructure providers.
      resolved: true
