      description: Between 2025-06-10 12:25 UTC and 2025-06-11 01:51 UTC, GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC) customers with approximately 10,000 or more users, saw performance degradation and 5xx errors when loading the Enterprise Settingsâ€™ People management page. Less than 2% of page requests resulted in an error. The issue was caused by a database change that replaced an index required for the page load. The issue was resolved by reverting the database change.<br /><br />To prevent similar incidents, we are improving the testing and validation process for replacing database indexes.
