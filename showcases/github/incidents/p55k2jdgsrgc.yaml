      description: On July 16th, 2024, between 00:30 UTC and 03:07 UTC, Copilot Chat was degraded and rejected all requests. The error rate was close to 100% during this time period and customers would have received errors when attempting to use Copilot Chat. <br /><br />This was triggered during routine maintenance from a service provider, when GitHub services were disconnected and overwhelmed the dependent service during reconnections. <br /><br />To mitigate the issue in the future, we are working to improve our reconnection and circuit-breaking logic to dependent services to recover from this kind of event seamlessly, without overwhelming the other service.<br />
