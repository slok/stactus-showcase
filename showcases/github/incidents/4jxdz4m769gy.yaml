      description: We are seeing ongoing connection failures across Codespaces and Actions, including Enterprise Migrations. <br /><br />Linux ARM64 standard hosted runners are failing to start, but Ubuntu latest and Windows latest are not affected at this time. <br /><br />SSH connections to Codespaces may be successful, but connections via VS Code are consistently failing. <br /><br />GitHub and Azure teams are coordinating to mitigate impact and resolve the root issues.

      description: Additional impact from this incident:<br /><br />Weâ€™re currently investigating an issue causing the Copilot Metrics API report URLs to fail for 28-day and 1-day enterprise and user reports. We are collaborating with Azure teams to restore access as soon as possible.

      description: We continue to see improvement in Actions larger runners jobs. Larger runners customers may still experience longer than normal queue times, but we expect this to rapidly improve across most runners. <br /><br />ARM64 runners, GPU runners, and some runners with private networking may still be impacted.<br /><br />Usage of Codespaces via VS Code (but not via SSH) is still degraded.<br /><br />GitHub and Azure teams continue to collaborate towards full resolution.
