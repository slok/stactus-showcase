      description: We are seeing ongoing connection failures across Codespaces and Actions, including Enterprise Migrations. <br /><br />Linux ARM64 standard hosted runners are failing to start, but Ubuntu latest and Windows latest are not affected at this time. <br /><br />SSH connections to Codespaces may be successful, but connections via VS Code are consistently failing. <br /><br />GitHub and Azure teams are coordinating to mitigate impact and resolve the root issues.

      description: Additional impact from this incident:<br /><br />We’re currently investigating an issue causing the Copilot Metrics API report URLs to fail for 28-day and 1-day enterprise and user reports. We are collaborating with Azure teams to restore access as soon as possible.

      description: We continue to see improvement in Actions larger runners jobs. Larger runners customers may still experience longer than normal queue times, but we expect this to rapidly improve across most runners. <br /><br />ARM64 runners, GPU runners, and some runners with private networking may still be impacted.<br /><br />Usage of Codespaces via VS Code (but not via SSH) is still degraded.<br /><br />GitHub and Azure teams continue to collaborate towards full resolution.

      description: On October 29th, 2025 between 14:07 UTC and 23:15 UTC, multiple GitHub services were degraded due to a broad outage in one of our service providers:<br /><br />- Users of Codespaces experienced failures connecting to new and existing Codespaces through VSCode Desktop or Web. On average the Codespace connection error rate was 90% and peaked at 100% across all regions throughout the incident period.<br />- GitHub Actions larger hosted runners experienced degraded performance, with 0.5% of overall workflow runs and 9.8% of larger hosted runner jobs failing or not starting within 5 minutes.  These recovered by 20:40 UTC.<br />- The GitHub Enterprise Importer service was degraded, with some users experiencing migration failures during git push operations and most users experiencing delayed migration processing.<br />- Initiation of new trials for GitHub Enterprise Cloud with Data Residency were also delayed during this time.<br />- Copilot Metrics via the API could not access the downloadable link during this time. There were approximately 100 requests during the incident that would have failed the download. Recovery began around 20:25 UTC.<br /><br />We were able to apply a number of mitigations to reduce impact over the course of the incident, but we did not achieve 100% recovery until our service provider’s incident was resolved.<br /><br />We are working to reduce critical path dependencies on the service provider and gracefully degrade experiences where possible so that we are more resilient to future dependency outages.
