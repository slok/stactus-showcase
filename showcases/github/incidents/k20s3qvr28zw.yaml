      description: On July 8, 2025, between 14:20 UTC and 16:30 UTC, GitHub Actions service experienced degraded performance leading to delays in updates to Actions workflow runs including missing logs and delayed run status. During this period, 1.07% of Actions workflow runs experienced delayed updates, while 0.34% of runs completed, but showed as canceled in their status. The incident was caused by imbalanced load in our underlying service infrastructure. The issue was mitigated by scaling up our services and tuning resource thresholds. We are working to improve our resilience to load spikes, capacity planning to prevent similar issues, and are implementing more robust monitoring to reduce detection and mitigation time for similar incidents in the future.
