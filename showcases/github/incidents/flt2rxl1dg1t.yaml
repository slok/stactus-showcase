      description: On February 25th, 2025, between 14:25 UTC and 16:44 UTC email and web notifications experienced delivery delays. At the peak of the incident the delay resulted in ~10% of all notifications taking over 10 minutes to be delivered, with the remaining ~90% being delivered within 5-10 minutes. This was due to insufficient capacity in worker pools as a result of increased load during peak hours.<br /><br />We also encountered delivery delays for a small number of webhooks, with delays of up-to 2.5 minutes to be delivered.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by scaling out the service to meet the demand.<br /><br />The increase in capacity gives us extra headroom, and we are working to improve our capacity planning to prevent issues like this occurring in the future.
