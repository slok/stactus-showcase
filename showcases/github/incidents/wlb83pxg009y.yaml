        Between September 27, 2024, 15:26 UTC and September 27, 2024, 15:34 UTC the Repositories Releases service was degraded. During this time 9% of requests to list releases via API or the webpage received a `500 Internal Server` error.

        This was due to a bug in our software roll out strategy. The rollout was reverted starting at 15:30 UTC, which began to restore functionality. The rollback was completed at 15:34 UTC.

        We are continuing to improve our testing infrastructure to ensure that bugs such as this one can be detected before they make their way into production.
