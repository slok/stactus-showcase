      description: Between July 28, 2025 16:31 UTC to July 29, 2025 12:05 UTC users saw degraded Git Operations for raw file downloads. On average, the error rate was .005%, with a peak error rate of 3.89%. This was due to a sustained increase in unauthenticated repository traffic.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by applying regional rate limiting, rolling back a service that was unable to scale with the additional traffic, and addressed a bug that impacted the caching of raw requests. Additionally, we horizontally scaled several dependencies of the service to appropriately handle the increase in traffic.<br /><br />We are working on improving our time to detection and have implemented controls to prevent similar incidents in future.
