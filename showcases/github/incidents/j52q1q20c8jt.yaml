      description: On July 23rd, 2025, from approximately 14:30 to 16:30 UTC, GitHub Actions experienced delayed job starts for workflows in private repos using Ubuntu-24 standard hosted runners. This was due to resource provisioning failures in one of our datacenter regions. During this period, approximately 2% of Ubuntu-24 hosted runner jobs on private repos were delayed. Other hosted runners, self-hosted runners, and public repo workflows were unaffected.<br /><br />To mitigate the issue, additional worker capacity was added from a different datacenter region at 15:35 UTC and further increased at 16:00 UTC. By 16:30 UTC, job queues were healthy and service was operating normally. Since the incident, we have deployed changes to improve how regional health is accounted for when allocating new runners, and we are investigating further improvements to our automated capacity scaling logic and manual overrides to prevent a recurrence.
