      description: 'On October 11, 2024, starting at 05:59 UTC, DNS infrastructure in one of our sites started to fail to resolve lookups following a database migration. Attempts to recover the database led to cascading failures that impacted the DNS systems for that site. The team worked to restore the infrastructure and there was no customer impact until 17:31 UTC. <br /><br />During the incident, impact to the following services could be observed:<br /><br />- Copilot: Degradation in IDE code completions for 4% of active users during the incident from 17:31 UTC to 21:45 UTC.<br />- Actions: Workflow runs delay (25% of runs delayed by over 5 minutes) and errors (1%) between 20:28 UTC and 21:30 UTC. Errors while creating Artifact Attestations.<br />- Customer migrations: From 18:16 UTC to 23:12 UTC running migrations stopped and new ones were not able to start.<br />- Support: support.github.com was unavailable from 19:28 UTC to 22:14 UTC. <br />- Code search: 100% of queries failed between 2024-10-11 20:16 UTC and 2024-10-12 00:46 UTC.<br /><br />Starting at 18:05 UTC, engineering attempted to repoint the degraded site DNS to a different site to restore DNS functionality. At 18:26 UTC the test system had validated this approach and a progressive rollout to the affected hosts proceeded over the next hour. While this mitigation was effective at restoring connectivity within the site, it caused issues with connectivity from healthy sites back to the degraded site, and the team proceeded to plan out a different remediation effort.<br /><br />At 20:52 UTC, the team finalized a remediation plan and began the next phase of mitigation by deploying temporary DNS resolution capabilities to the degraded site. At 21:46 UTC, DNS resolution in the degraded site began to recover and was fully healthy at 22:16 UTC. Lingering issues with code search were resolved at 01:11 UTC on October 12.<br /><br />The team continued to restore the original functionality within the site after public service functionality was restored. GitHub is working to harden our resiliency and automation processes around this infrastructure to make diagnosing and resolving issues like this faster in the future.'
