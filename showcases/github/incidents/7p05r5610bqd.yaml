      description: "Between Sunday 20:50 UTC and Monday 15:20 UTC the Migrations service was unable to process migrations. This was due to a invalid infrastructure credential. \n\nWe mitigated the issue by updating the credential internally.\n\nMechanisms and automation will be implemented to detect and prevent this issue again in the future."
