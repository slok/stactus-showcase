      description: On January 6th, 2026, between approximately 8:41 and 10:07 UTC, the Copilot service experienced a degradation of the GPT-5.1-Codex-Max model due to an issue with our upstream provider. During this time, up to 14.17% of requests to GPT-5.1-Codex-Max failed. No other models were impacted.<br /><br />The issue was resolved by a mitigation put in place by our provider. GitHub is working with our provider to further improve the resiliency of the service to prevent similar incidents in the future.
