      description: Due to a degradation of one instance of our internal message delivery service, a percentage of jobs started between 06/30/2025 19:18 UTC and 06/30/2025 19:50 UTC failed, and are no longer retry-able. Runners assigned to these jobs will automatically recover within 24 hours, but deleting and recreating the runner will free up the runner immediately.
