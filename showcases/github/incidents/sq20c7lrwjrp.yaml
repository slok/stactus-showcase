        From January 14, 2026, at 18:15 UTC until January 15, 2026, at 11:30 UTC, GitHub Copilot users were unable to select the GPT-5 model for chat features in VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, and other IDE integrations. Users running GPT-5 in Auto mode experienced errors. Other models were not impacted.

        We mitigated this incident by deploying a fix that corrected a misconfiguration in available models, rendering the GPT-5 model available again.

        We are improving our testing processes to reduce the risk of similar incidents in the future, and refining our model availability alerting to improve detection time.

        We did not status before we completed the fix, and the incident is currently resolved. We are sorry for the delayed post on githubstatus.com.
      resolved: true
