      description: On November 24, 2025, between 12:15 and 15:04 UTC, Codespaces users encountered connection issues when attempting to create a codespace after choosing the recently released VS Code Codespaces extension, version 1.18.1. Users were able to downgrade to the 1.18.0 version of the extension during this period to work around this issue. At peak, the error rate was 19% of connection requests. This was caused by mismatching version dependencies for the released VS Code Codespaces extension.<br /><br />The connection issues were mitigated by releasing the VS Code Codespaces extension version 1.18.2 that addressed the issue. Users utilizing version 1.18.1 of the VS Code Codespaces extension are advised to upgrade to version >=1.18.2.<br /><br />We are improving our validation and release process for this extension to ensure functional issues like this are caught before release to customers and to reduce detection and mitigation times for extension issues like this in the future.
