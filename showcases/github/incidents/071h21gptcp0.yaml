      description: On October 1, 2025 between 07:00 UTC and 17:20 UTC, Mac hosted runner capacity for Actions was degraded, leading to timed out jobs and long queue times. On average, the error rate was 46% and peaked at 96% of requests to the service. XL and Intel runners recovered by 10:10 UTC, with the other types taking longer to recover.<br /><br />The degraded capacity was triggered by a scheduled event at 07:00 UTC that led to a permission failure on Mac runner hosts, blocking reimage operations.  The permission issue was resolved by 9:41 UTC, but the recovery of available runners took longer than expected due to a combination of backoff logic slowing backend operations and some hosts needing state resets.<br /><br />We deployed changes immediately following the incident to address the scheduled event and ensure that similar failures will not block critical operations in the future. We are also working to reduce the end-to-end time for self-healing of offline hosts for quicker full recovery of future capacity or host events.
