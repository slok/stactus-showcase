        GitHub Enterprise Importer migration systems are currently impacted by a pause to Migration Mannequin Reclaiming.
        At 19:43 UTC on 2025-11-19, we paused the queue that processes Mannequin Reclaiming work done at the end of a migration.
        This was done after observing load that threatened the health of the overall system. The cause has been identified, and efforts to fix are underway.

        In the current state:
          - all requests to Reclaim Mannequins will be held in a queue
          - those requests will be processed when repair work is complete and the queue unpaused, at which time the incident will be closed

        This does not impact processing of migration runs using GitHub Enterprise Importer, only mannequin reclamation.
