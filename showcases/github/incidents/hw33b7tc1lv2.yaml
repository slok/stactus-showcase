      description: On June 26th, between 14:42UTC and 18:05UTC, the GitHub Enterprise Importer (GEI) service was in a degraded state, during which time, customers of the service experienced extended repository migration durations.<br /><br />Our investigation found that the combined effect of several database updates resulted in the severe throttling of GEI to preserve overall database health.<br /><br />We have taken steps to prevent additional impact and are working to implement additional safeguards to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
