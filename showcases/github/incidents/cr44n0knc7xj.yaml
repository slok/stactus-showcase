      description: Beginning at 8:38 PM UTC on July 31, 2024 and lasting until 9:28 PM UTC on July 31, 2024, some customers of github.com saw errors when navigating to the Billing pages and/or when updating their payment method. These errors were caused due to a degradation in one of our partner services. A fix was deployed by the partner services and the Billing pages are back to being functional. <br /><br />For improved detection of such issues in future, we will work with the partner service to identify levers we can use to get an earlier indication of issues.
