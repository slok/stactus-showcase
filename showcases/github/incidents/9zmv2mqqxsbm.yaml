      description: On May 1, 2025 from 22:09 UTC to 23:13 UTC, the Issues service was degraded and users weren't able to upload attachments. The root cause was identified to be a new feature which added a custom header to all client-side HTTP requests, causing a CORS errors when uploading attachments to our provider.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by rolling back the feature flag that added the new header at 22:56 UTC. In order to prevent this from happening again, we are adding new metrics to monitor and ensure the safe rollout of changes to client-side requests.
