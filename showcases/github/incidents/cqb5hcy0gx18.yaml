      description: On January 22, 2026, our authentication service experienced an issue between 14:00 UTC and 14:50 UTC, resulting in downstream disruptions for users.<br /><br />From 14:00 UTC to 14:23 UTC, authenticated API requests experienced higher-than-normal error rates, with an average of 16.9% and occasional peaks up to 22.2% resulting in HTTP 401 responses for authenticated API requests. <br /><br />From 14:00 UTC to 14:50 UTC, git operations over HTTP were impacted, with error rates averaging 3.8% and peaking at 10.8%. As a result, some users may have been unable to run git commands as expected.<br /><br />This was due to the authentication service reaching the maximum allowed number of database connections. We mitigated the incident by increasing the maximum number of database connections in the authentication service.<br /><br />We are adding additional monitoring around database connection pool usage and improving our traffic projection to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.<br />
