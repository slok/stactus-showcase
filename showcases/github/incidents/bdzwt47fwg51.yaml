      description: On September 30th, 2024 from 10:43 UTC to 11:26 UTC Codespaces customers in the Central India region were unable to create new Codespaces. Resumes were not impacted. Additionally, there was no impact to customers in other regions.<br /><br />The cause was traced to storage capacity constraints in the region and was mitigated by temporarily redirecting create requests to other regions. Afterwards, additional storage capacity was added to the region and traffic was routed back. <br /><br />A bug was also identified that caused some available capacity to not be utilized, artificially constraining capacity and halting creations in the region prematurely. We have since fixed this bug as well, so that available capacity scales as expected according to our capacity planning projections.
      resolved: true
