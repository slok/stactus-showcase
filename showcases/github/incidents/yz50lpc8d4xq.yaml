      description: On March 18, between 13:04 and 16:55 UTC, Actions workflows relying on hosted runners using the beta MacOS 15 image experienced increased queue time waiting for available runners.  An image update was pushed the previous day that included a performance reduction.  The slower performance caused longer average runtimes, exhausting our available Mac capacity for this image.  This was mitigated by rolling back the image update.  We have updated our capacity allocation to the beta and other Mac images and are improving monitoring in our canary environments to catch this potential issue before it impacts customers.
