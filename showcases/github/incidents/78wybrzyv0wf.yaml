      description: On January 16, 2025, between 00:45 UTC and 09:40 UTC the Pull Requests service was degraded and failed to generate rebase merge commits. This was due to a configuration change that introduced disagreements between replicas. These disagreements caused a secondary job to run, triggering timeouts while computing rebase merge commits. <br /><br />We mitigated the incident by rolling back the configuration change.<br /><br />We are working on improving our monitoring and deployment practices to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.
