      description: From Oct 22, 2025 15:00 UTC to Oct 24, 2025 14:30 UTC  git operations via SSH saw periods of increased latency and failed requests, with failure rates ranging from 1.5% to a single spike of 15%. Git operations over http were not affected. This was due to resource exhaustion on our backend ssh servers.  <br /><br />We mitigated the incident by increasing the available resources for ssh connections. We are improving the observability and dynamic scalability of our backend to prevent issues like this in the future.
