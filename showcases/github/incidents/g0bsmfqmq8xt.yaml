      description: On August 21st, 2025, between 6:15am UTC and 6:25am UTC Git and Web operations were degraded and saw intermittent errors. On average, the error rate was 1% for API and Web requests. This was due to database infrastructure automated maintenance reducing capacity below our tolerated threshold.<br /><br />The incident was resolved when the impacted infrastructure self-healed and returned to normal operating capacity.<br /><br />We are adding guardrails to reduce the impact of this type of maintenance in the future.
