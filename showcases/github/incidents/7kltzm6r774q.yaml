      description: On June 18, 2025, between 15:15 UTC and 19:29 UTC, the Issues service was degraded, and certain GraphQL queries accessing the `ReactionGroup.reactors` field returned errors. Our query routing infrastructure was impacted by exceptions from a particular database migration, resulting in errors for an average of 0.0097% of overall GraphQL requests (peaking at 0.02%).<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting the migration.<br /><br />We continue to investigate the cause of the exceptions and are holding off on similar migrations until the underlying issue is understood and resolved.
