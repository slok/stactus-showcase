      description: We are seeing an increase in Codespaces creation and resuming failures across multiple regions, primarily in EMEA. Our team are analysing the situation and are working to mitigate this impact.<br /><br />While we are working, customers are advised to create Codespaces in US East and US West regions via the "New with options..." button when creating a Codespace.<br /><br />More updates as we have them.

      description: We have identified the issue causing Codespace create/resume actions to fail and are applying a fix. This is estimated to take ~2 hours to complete but impact will begin to reduce sooner than that.<br /><br />We will continue to monitor recovery progress and will report back when more information is available.
      investigating: true

      description: On February 12, 2026, between 00:51 UTC and 09:35 UTC, users attempting to create or resume Codespaces experienced elevated failure rates across Europe, Asia and Australia, peaking at a 90% failure rate.<br /><br />The disconnects were triggered by a bad configuration rollout in a core networking dependency, which led to internal resource provisioning failures. We are working to improve our alerting thresholds to catch issues before they impact customers and strengthening rollout safeguards to prevent similar incidents.
