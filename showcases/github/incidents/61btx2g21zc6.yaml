      description: Between July 28, 2025, 22:23:00 UTC and July 29, 2025 02:06:00 UTC, GitHub experienced degraded performance across multiple services including API, Issues, GraphQL and Pull Requests. During this time, approximately 4% of Web and API requests resulted in 500 errors. <br /><br />This incident was caused by DNS resolution failure while decommissioning infrastructure hosts. We resolved the incident by removing references to the stale hosts.<br /><br />We are working to improve our host replacement process by correcting our automatic host ejection behavior and by ensuring configuration is updated before hosts are decommissioned. This will prevent similar issues in the future.
