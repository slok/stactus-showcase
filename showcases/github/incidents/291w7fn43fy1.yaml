      description: On March 3rd 2025 between 04:07 UTC and 09:36 UTC various GitHub services were degraded with an average error rate of 0.03% and peak error rate of 9%. This issue impacted web requests, API requests, and git operations. <br /><br />This incident was triggered because a network node in one of GitHub's datacenter sites partially failed, resulting in silent packet drops for traffic served by that site. At 09:22 UTC, we identified the failing network node, and at 09:36 UTC we addressed the issue by removing the faulty network node from production.<br /><br />In response to this incident, we are improving our monitoring capabilities to identify and respond to similar silent errors more effectively in the future.
