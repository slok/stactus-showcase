      description: On June 6, 2025, between 00:21 UTC to 12:40 UTC the Copilot service was degraded and a subset of Copilot Free users were unable to sign up for or use the Copilot Free service on github.com. This was due to a change in licensing code that resulted in some users losing access despite being eligible for Copilot Free.<br />We mitigated this through a rollback of the offending change at 11:39 AM UTC. This resulted in users once again being able to utilize their Copilot Free access.<br />As a result of this incident, we have improved monitoring of Copilot changes during rollout. We are also working to reduce our time to detect and mitigate issues like this one in the future.
