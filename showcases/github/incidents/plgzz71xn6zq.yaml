      description: On January 9, 2025, between 01:26 UTC and 01:56 UTC GitHub experienced widespread disruption to many services, with users receiving 500 responses when trying to access various functionality. This was due to a deployment which introduced a query that saturated a primary database server. On average, the error rate was 6% and peaked at 6.85% of update requests.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by identifying the source of the problematic query and rolling back the deployment.<br /><br />We are investigating methods to detect problematic queries prior to deployment to prevent, and to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.
