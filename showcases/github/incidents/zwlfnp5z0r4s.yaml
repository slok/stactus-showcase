      description: Between 2026-01-13 22:20 and 2026-01-14 00:18 UTC, GitHub Code Search experienced an increase in latency and request timeouts. This was caused by some network transit links between GitHub and Azure Express Route experiencing a small error rate that contributed to applications requests failing, increasing application latency and timeouts. The incident resulted in less than 1% of requests to fail due to timeouts.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by disabling the links in question. Monitoring each unique network path across providers would have allowed us to mitigate this earlier. We are running root cause analysis with network providers to help us reduce time-to-discover and time-to-mitigate.
