      description: We have disabled the Gemini 2.5 Pro model in Copilot Chat, VS Code and other Copilot products due to an issue with an upstream model provider.<br /><br />Users may still see these models as available for a brief period but we recommend switching to a different model. Other models are not impacted and are available.<br /><br />Once our model provider has resolved the issues impacting Gemini 2.5 Pro, we will re-enable it.

      description: The issues with our upstream model provider have been resolved, and Gemini 2.5 Pro is available again in Copilot Chat, VS Code, and other Copilot products.<br /><br />We will continue monitoring to ensure stability, but mitigation is complete.

      description: Between May 15, 2025 10:10 UTC and May 15, 2025 22:58 UTC the Copilot service was degraded and returned a high volume of internal server errors for requests targeting Gemini 2.5 Pro, a public preview model. This was due to a high volume of rate limiting by the upstream model provider, similar in volume to the internal server errors during the previous day.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by temporarily disabling Gemini 2.5 Pro for all Copilot Chat experiences, and then worked with the model provider to ensure model health was sufficiently improved before re-enabling.<br /><br />We are working with the model provider to move to more resilient infrastructure to mitigate issues like this one in the future.
      resolved: true
