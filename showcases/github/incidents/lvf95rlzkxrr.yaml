      description: On February 13, 2026, between 21:46 UTC and 22:58 UTC (72 minutes), the GitHub file upload service was degraded and users uploading from a web browser on GitHub.com were unable to upload files to repositories, create release assets, or upload manifest files. During the incident, successful upload completions dropped by ~85% from baseline levels. This was due to a code change that inadvertently modified browser request behavior and violated CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy requirements, causing upload requests to be blocked before reaching the upload service.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting the code change that introduced the issue.<br /><br />We are working to improve automated testing for browser-side request changes and to add monitoring/automated safeguards for upload flows to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of similar issues in the future.
