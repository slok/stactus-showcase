      description: We are experiencing degraded availability for the Claude Sonnet 3.7 and Claude Sonnet 4 model in Copilot Chat, VS Code and other Copilot products. This is due to an issue with an upstream model provider. We are working with them to resolve the issue.<br /><br />Other models are available and working as expected.

      description: Between 20:06 UTC September 23 and 04:58 UTC September 24, 2025, the Copilot service experienced degraded availability for Claude Sonnet 4 and 3.7 model requests.<br /><br />During this period, 0.46% of Claude 4 requests and 7.83% of Claude 3.7 requests failed.<br /><br />The reduced availability resulted from Copilot disabling routing to an upstream provider that was experiencing issues and reallocating capacity to other providers to manage requests for Claude Sonnet 3.7 and 4.<br />We are continuing to investigate the source of the issues with this provider and will provide an update as more information becomes available.
      resolved: true
