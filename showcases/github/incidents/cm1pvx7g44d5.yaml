      description: We are experiencing degraded availability for the Claude Sonnet 3.7 and Claude Sonnet 4 model in Copilot Chat, VS Code and other Copilot products. This is due to an issue with an upstream model provider. We are working with them to resolve the issue.<br /><br />Other models are available and working as expected.
