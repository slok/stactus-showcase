      description: On March 8, 2025, between 17:16 UTC and 18:02 UTC, GitHub Actions and Pages services experienced degraded performance leading to delays in workflow runs and Pages deployments. During this time, 34% of Actions workflow runs experienced delays, and a small percentage of runs using GitHub-hosted runners failed to start. Additionally, Pages deployments for sites without a custom Actions workflow (93% of them) did not run, preventing new changes from being deployed. <br /><br />An unexpected data shape led to crashes in some of our pods. We mitigated the incident by excluding the affected pods and correcting the data that led to the crashes. Weâ€™ve fixed the source of the unexpected data shape and have improved the overall resilience of our service against such occurrences.
