      description: On November 12, 2025, between 22:10 UTC and 23:04 UTC, Codespaces used internally at GitHub were impacted. There was no impact to external customers. The scope of impact was not clear in the initial steps of incident response, so it was considered public until confirmed otherwise. One improvement from this will be improved clarity of internal versus public impact for similar failures to better inform our status decisions going forward.
