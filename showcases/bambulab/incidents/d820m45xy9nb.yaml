        From 2023/3/15 11:43 - 12:27 UTC, in order to fix the problem with Apple's third-party login, we upgraded the cloud service. During the upgrade process, there were some failures/delays when starting print tasks.
        After the upgrade process was finished, the service returned to normal.
      resolved: true
