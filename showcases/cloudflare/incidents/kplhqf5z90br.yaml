        Cloudflare is investigating issues with Cloudflare Dashboard: Attempts to switch from CNAME to A record (or vice versa) via Dashboard UI are not working at the moment.

        These issues do not affect the serving of cached files via the Cloudflare CDN or other security features at the Cloudflare Edge.

        The issue has been identified and we are working on implementing a fix.
