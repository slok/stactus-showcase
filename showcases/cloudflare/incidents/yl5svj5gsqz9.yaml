        Cloudflare is investigating an issue with Cloudflare for SaaS Custom Hostname search. Some customers are unable to search for Custom Hostnames in the dashboard.

        These issues do not affect the serving of cached files via the Cloudflare CDN or other security features at the Cloudflare Edge.

        Customers using the Dashboard are impacted as requests might fail and/or errors may be displayed.
      investigating: true

        We are continuing to work on a fix for this issue.

        In the meantime, customers can work around this by doing the following:

        While on the Custom hostname page, navigate to any other tab on the page and then back to the Custom hostnames tab and the search functionality will work.
