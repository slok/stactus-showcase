        Cloudflare is investigating an issue with Cloudflare for SaaS Custom Hostname search. Some customers are unable to search for Custom Hostnames in the dashboard.

        These issues do not affect the serving of cached files via the Cloudflare CDN or other security features at the Cloudflare Edge.

        Customers using the Dashboard are impacted as requests might fail and/or errors may be displayed.
      investigating: true
