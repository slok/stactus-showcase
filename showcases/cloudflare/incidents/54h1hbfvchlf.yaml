        A small number of users are reporting severe increases in query latency when querying D1 databases and SQLite-backed Durable Objects. This is resulting in timeouts and/or hard errors for those queries.

        We are investigating the cause and potential fixes and will provide updates with our findings.

      description: Investigation identified the issue is a recurrence of https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/incidents/kzvk0c2s5fy7, whose remediation did not fully address the elevated errors and query timeouts. We are actively implementing additional fixes to address the errors and timeouts.

      description: We are continuing to work on a fix for this issue. Observed errors target only a small number of Durable Objects and D1 databases (D1 errors are less than 0.1% of total requests).
