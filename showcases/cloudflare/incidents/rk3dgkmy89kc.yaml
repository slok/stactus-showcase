      description: A recent software update inadvertently altered the ordering of DNS records within our cached responses. Specifically, the sequence of CNAME and non-CNAME records in the "answer" section was changed, which conflicted with the expectations of certain DNS client implementations. Upon identifying this behavior, we reverted the release to restore standard record ordering and resolve connectivity issues for affected users.
