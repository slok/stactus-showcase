      description: Customers with R2 buckets in Eastern Europe (EEUR) and Western Europe (WEUR) may experience an increase in error rates on GET requests. While overall error rates in these regions remain low,  some workloads may be affected disproportionately resulting in higher than expected error rates. We are aware of the issue and are actively investigating. Further detail will be provided as more information becomes available.

      description: We have identified and remediated an issue in our API service and underlying object storage in the AMS region. Impact on customer read workloads should be fully mitigated at this point, and we're monitoring to ensure no regressions.
