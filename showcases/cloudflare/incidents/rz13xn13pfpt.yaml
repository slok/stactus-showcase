        Cloudflare is investigating issues with the API for URL lists, bulk redirect lists and hostname lists.

        Customers using the dashboard or Cloudflare APIs may find that their changes have a significant delay before taking effect at the Cloudflare Edge.

        These issues do not affect the serving of cached files via the Cloudflare CDN or other security features at the Cloudflare Edge.
