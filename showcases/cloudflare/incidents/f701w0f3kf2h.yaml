      description: |-
        Between 17:45-21:45 UTC on 4th March, a subsea cable fault between Asia and Europe resulted in reduced network capacity. This caused impact to Cloudflare and other third party networks resulting in heavy congestion on alternate paths.

        Customers may have experienced increased latency and/or connectivity issues whilst automated systems and Cloudflare engineering worked to mitigate impact.
