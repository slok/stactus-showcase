      description: Cloudflare single-file cache purging (purge by URL) called via the Dashboard/API is running up to 60 minutes behind only on the China Network. We are working to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Until then you may use a different purge feature but do be aware it may cause additional traffic to your origin server(s). More updates to follow.
