        Cloudflare released a WARP Client update on 2024-11-11 for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Due to reports from several customers that a portion of their fleets could not connect to WARP after upgrading to this new version, a decision was made on 2024-11-12 at 15:39 to pull the problematic macOS GA build (2024.11.143.0). Windows and Linux releases are not affected by this.

        Customers are advised to revert to the previous stable release (2024.9.346.0) if they experience issues with macOS devices unable to connect.
      resolved: true
