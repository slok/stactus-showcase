      description: Cloudflare is currently investigating an issue affecting the display of the Wildcard Pattern interface in the Redirect Rules builder. Users may experience unavailability or encounter unexpected errors. This issue does not affect the deployment of new rules via custom filter expressions, and existing rules continue to function as expected.
