        Cloudflare single-file cache purging (purge by URL) called via the Dashboard/API is running up to 30 minutes behind in Eastern North America (ENAM). This also affects the "Always Online" feature.

        We are working to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Until then you may use the Purge Everything feature but do be aware it may cause a surge in traffic to your origin server(s). More updates to follow.
