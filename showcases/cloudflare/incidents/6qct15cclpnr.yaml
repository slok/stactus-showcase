        We are currently investigating an issue where some users of our 1.1.1.1 with WARP Consumer product may see performance issues browsing the web with DNS over WARP mode enabled.

        As a temporary workaround until this issue is resolved please move to DNS over HTTP mode by navigating to Settings -> Advanced -> Connection Options -> DNS settings -> Protocol options and selecting "DNS over HTTPS".
      investigating: true
