        Since 2024-11-21 13:00, Workers Smart Placement is not analyzing Workers and potentially running them in non-optimal locations. This mainly affects Workers that just turned Smart Placement on. If a Worker already has Smart Placement on, it will continue with the last analyzed placement.

        Workers traffic is not affected.
