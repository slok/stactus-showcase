        Weâ€™ve identified an issue where newly deployed Snippets may not execute correctly at the edge. In some cases, this can result in exceptions being served to end users.

        Snippets that were deployed prior to this incident continue to function normally, and there is no impact to the control plane, dashboard, or API.

        We are actively investigating and working on a fix. As a temporary precaution, we recommend postponing critical production changes involving new Snippet deployments.

        We will provide updates as soon as more information becomes available.
