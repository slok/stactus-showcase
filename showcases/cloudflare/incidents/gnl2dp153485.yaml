      description: "We are currently observing and working to resolve the following Billing issues:\n \nFailed Plan Modifications:\nThere are intermittent issues with subscription upgrades, downgrades, and cancellations. This may result in billing charges being applied without the subscription level being updated. In these cases you may contact Cloudflare Support. \n\nUnpaid Invoices Preventing Plan Modifications:\nIf you encounter an error message when attempting to modify your plan, the most common cause is an unpaid invoice. In these cases, check if you have an unpaid invoice before contacting Support.\n\nMissing Invoices:\nSome unpaid invoices are not visible. These unpaid invoices will still prevent account modifications. In these cases you may contact Cloudflare Support. \n\nMissing Pay Now Buttons:\nFor each unpaid invoice there should be a corresponding “Pay Now” button. If that button is not there you can click on the payment link directly within the invoice.\n\nExpired Payment Links:\nAfter 120 days the payment links will expire, so if you have no “Pay Now” button and the link within the invoice is expired, you will need to contact to Support\n\nDuplicate Payments:\nYou may notice multiple invoices and charges on your bank and PayPal statements that appear to be duplicates. In most cases these are valid, unique charges for previously unpaid months where we were unable to collect your payments. You should not contact support about these cases. \n\nDue to ongoing billing issues, we are experiencing high demand—please avoid opening duplicate tickets and wait for our response."
