        Between 05:45am and 06:25am UTC, Cloudflare has identified and mitigated an issue with our API which potentially impacted multiple customers: Performing bulk requests to our Custom Hostnames API endpoint might have returned unexpected timeouts.
        This did not affect the serving of cached files via the Cloudflare CDN or other security features at the Cloudflare Edge.
      resolved: true
