        Cloudflare recently identified and applied a fix for issues with Cloudflare Dashboard and related APIs.

        These issues do not affect the serving of cached files via the Cloudflare CDN or other security features at the Cloudflare Edge.

        Customers using the Dashboard / Cloudflare APIs may be impacted as requests might fail and/or errors may be displayed.

        We are currently monitoring the results of the fix.
