        An issue prevented a subset of new Cloudflare Tunnel and WARP connections from being established between 07:00 and 08:45 AM UTC on Sunday, August 10th. This problem has been fully resolved, and all services are operating normally.

        During this time window, customers may have experienced errors when attempting to restart or initiate new connections via cloudflared. This may also have impacted customers using WARP-to-WARP connectivity or Magic WAN customers who leverage WARP as an on-ramp.

        The issue was limited to the establishment of new connections; existing tunnels and connections were not affected. This issue also did not affect any other Cloudflare services.

        Our team has addressed the root cause, and we will continue to monitor the service to ensure continued stability. We apologize for any disruption this may have caused our customers.
      resolved: true
