        Cloudflare is investigating minor issues with Cloudflare Dashboard. Some customers are unable to configure account memberships from the dashboard.

        These issues do not affect the serving of cached files via the Cloudflare CDN or other security features at the Cloudflare Edge.

        Customers using the Dashboard / Cloudflare APIs are impacted as requests might fail and/or errors may be displayed.
      investigating: true
