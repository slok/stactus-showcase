      description: "Cloudflare was investigating an issue affecting WARP Connector where traffic destined for specific Private IP CIDR ranges failed to route correctly for a small subset of accounts. \n\nThis occurred between 2025-11-20 18:09 UTC to 2025-11-21 13:44 UTC. \n\nDuring this window, affected WARP Connectors may have appeared connected but failed to pass traffic to specific internal resources.\n\nOur engineering team identified the underlying cause and deployed a fix. This issue is fully resolved now."
