        Some customers may have encountered an issue where changes made to the OWASP Managed Rulesets are not accurately reflected in the Cloudflare Dashboard User Interface.

        This is a cosmetic issue with the Cloudflare Dashboard, and refreshing the page will reflect the correct value set. The Cloudflare API is not affected.

        This issue is expected to be fixed before 15th September 2024.
      resolved: true
