        Cloudflare released a WARP Client update on 2024-11-11 for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Due to reports from several customers that a portion of their fleets could not connect to WARP after upgrading to this new version, a decision was made on 2024-11-12 at 15:39 to pull the problematic macOS GA build (2024.11.143.0). Windows has now also been pulled.

        Customers are advised to revert to the previous stable releases. A fix is underway.
