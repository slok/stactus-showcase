        Workers Automatic Tracing has been re-enabled.

        User who had previously enabled tracing may need to redeploy with updated wrangler configuration including explicit opt-in to tracing using the 'observability.tracing.enabled' attribute.

        For more details on how to enable tracing see the documentation here: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/traces/#how-to-enable-tracing
