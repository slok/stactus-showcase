      description: |-
        We are investigating increased latency processing Processing for Distribution Metrics coming from the agent.
        As a result of this issue, some users may see delays or gaps for a subset of their metrics on graphs.
        RUM/Synthetics/Logs/Processes measures that depend on distribution metrics will also see delays.
        To prevent spurious alerts, we have temporarily disabled monitors based on this data.
