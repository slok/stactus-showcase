        We are actively investigating issues with Log Queries returning unexpected results.

        We have deployed a fix and we are monitoring the results. We will provide another update once the issue is fully resolved.

        At this time, newly ingested data is properly queryable, and monitors targeting Logs sent from 2023-10-03 20:40 UTC onwards are valid.

        Queries targeting logs between 2023-10-02 11:40 UTC and 2023-10-03 20:40 UTC may return erroneous data.  We are evaluating a fix that will restore query correctness for this time-window.
