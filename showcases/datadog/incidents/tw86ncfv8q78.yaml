        We are investigating increased latency processing Metrics from APM and distribution metrics.
        As a result of this issue, some users may see delays or gaps for metrics on graphs.
        To prevent spurious alerts, we have temporarily disabled monitors based on this data.

      description: We have identified the root cause, and scaled up the processing to catch up with the lag.

      description: The distribution metrics should be back to processing live, without latency. APM metrics are still being delayed, and we're actively working at getting it back to live.
