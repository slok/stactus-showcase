        We are investigating increased latency processing Events.

        As a result of this issue, some users may see delays in the event stream or for event queries on dashboards, and event alert evaluation is delayed.

        This issue also caused a delay in the processing of alerts across other products. We've implemented a fix for this, and are monitoring the recovery of the alert evaluation pipeline. As a result, a subset alerts may be delayed while the system recovers.
