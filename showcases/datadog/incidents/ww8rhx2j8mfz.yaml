        Note: this is a delayed update because this incident impaired our ability to update the status page, we posted banners earlier in the product to let customers know about the ongoing impact.
        We are still seeing some delays as we are fully recovering from the underlying incident: agentless vulnerability scanning for hosts in AWS us-east-1 is still delayed, On-Call notifications are not fully recovered. This incident started at 07:10 UTC on October 20.
        So far we have recovered fully from the impact on Synthetics, collection of data from AWS, Bits AI, Codegen, Dashboards (edition features were impaired).
