        We are investigating increased latency processing APM, RUM, Log Management and Profiling. As a result of this issue, some users may see only a subset of their data when querying those different products, other product pages using the same underlying product data will be impacted as well.
        We are working on bringing new capacity online and the data will be backfilled once the service is fully operational again.

        Monitors using the impacted data are delayed.

        We are still seeing increased latency processing for those products and the associated monitors are delayed.
        We are continuing to work on bringing new capacity online and will continue to provide updates on this issue.

        APM, RUM, Log Management, Profiling, CCM and Product Analytics data is still delayed. As a result of this issue, some users may see only a subset of their data when querying those different products, other product pages using the same underlying product data will be impacted as well.
        We are working on bringing new capacity online and for all products except RUM we expect the data will be backfilled once the service is fully operational again.
        App Builder and Workflow Automation are also experiencing elevated errors, as a result customers might not be to query applications and workflows might take longer to execute.
        Due to upstream provider issues, we are also continuing to see unavailability of telemetry data coming from AWS into Datadog.

        We are seeing progress in telemetry data coming from AWS into Datadog. Also, we are starting to see our capacity requests being fulfilled.
        Our processing is still delayed impacting multiple products - Distribution Metrics, APM, RUM, Log Management, Profiling, CCM and Product Analytics data is still delayed. As a result of this issue, some users may see only a subset of their data when querying those different products, other product pages using the same underlying product data will be impacted as well.

        We are seeing recovery in AWS Metrics. Logs data submitted after 21:30 UTC should be processed normally. Users may see gaps in historical logs prior to 21:30 UTC while our backfill is in progress.
        In addition to Log Management we continue to see delays in processing that impacts the following products: Distribution Metrics, APM, RUM, Profiling, CCM and Product Analytics. As a result of this issue, some users may see only a subset of their data when querying those products or viewing pages that rely on telemetry from those products.
