      description: Degraded network capacity in an Azure datacenter is causing network packet loss and increased latency when communicating with AWS in eastern US regions.  Customers may experience communications failures trying to submit data from agents running in AWS and may experience delayed data from AWS integrations.   Microsoft has identified the root cause and is working on mitigations.
      investigating: true

      description: |-
        Azure has temporarily mitigated the network capacity issues which have caused episodic packet loss for customers who are hosted in Azure data centers and are using Datadog’s US1 region (accessible via https://app.datadoghq.com). Azure engineers are continuing to work to fully resolve this issue.

        Until they fully resolve the issue, customers with Datadog agents running in Azure data centers may see brief periods of delayed ingestion of data from agents and from Azure integrations. We don’t expect a noticeable impact thanks to agent buffering but cannot exclude the possibility of spurious alerts due to temporarily delayed data.

        We are continuing to monitor the situation in conjunction with Azure, and will do so throughout the weekend. We will post status page updates as soon as the situation improves, and at least every 24 hours. We thank you for your patience throughout this incident.

      description: Azure has implemented a permanent fix to the network issue. Both Azure and Datadog engineers are continuing to monitor overnight and will provide an update tomorrow.
