      description: |-
        Between 11:00 and 14:50 UTC Grafana Cloud regions in Singapore ( prod-ap-southeast-1 ) and Indonesia ( prod-ap-southeast-2 ) experienced issues connecting to synthetic monitoring public probes hosted in Linode:  Atlanta, Toronto, Dallas, Newark.

        Synthetic monitor changes were delayed propagating to Atlanta, Toronto, Dallas, Newark by up to 30 minutes.  This affected customers in our  prod-ap-southeast-1 (Singapore) and prod-ap-southeast-2 (Indonesia) regions. As of 14:50 UTC these regions have maintained continuous connection to Linode probes. We continue to monitor these regions.
