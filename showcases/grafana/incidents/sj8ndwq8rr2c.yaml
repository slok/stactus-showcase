        Users may receive internet write failures on collectors stating:
        "Exporting failed. Will retry the request after interval. {"kind": "exporter", "data_type": "traces", "name": "otlp/cloud", "error": "rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = unexpected HTTP status code received from server: 502 (Bad Gateway)"

        The agent/collector will automatically retry the write attempt and succeed, so there is no loss in data collection.
