        Due to this bug reported in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/127370, we were affected by an issue causing K8S service endpoints not getting updated when pods are stopped/started if there are more than 1k pods matching the service.
        This caused a temporary outage in Mimir gossiping services, which further resulted in failures to ingest and query metrics for a short time.
        This issue has been resolved.
      resolved: true
