      description: Twilio Voice Intelligence engineering team has identified a condition that impacts a small number of transcripts created since 02/18/2025. During this period of time customers may have received duplicate sentences in their transcript results if they have multiple operator results for that sentence.

We will provide another update in 1 hour or as soon as more information becomes available.
