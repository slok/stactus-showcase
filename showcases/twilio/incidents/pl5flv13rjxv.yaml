      description: Our engineers are investigating the issue where the incorrect country is set during MFA configuration for 1st account setups and are working to identify a fix. The current workaround is to select the correct country in the dropdown, selecting a different country, and re-selecting the correct country. We expect to provide another update in 1 hour or as soon as more information becomes available.
