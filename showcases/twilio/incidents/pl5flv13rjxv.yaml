        Our engineers are investigating the issue where the incorrect billing country is set during MFA configuration for 1st account setups for non-US customers and are working to identify a fix.

        The suggested workaround is to select the correct billing country in the step that follows the MFA step during onboarding.

        We expect to provide another update in 1 hour or as soon as more information becomes available.
