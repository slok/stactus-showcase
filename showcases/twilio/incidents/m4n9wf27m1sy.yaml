      description: Beginning at 3:05 UTC, we observed ~9.5% of active data sessions on Super SIM being dropped. Devices that attempted to reconnect immediately after losing connectivity should have been able to successfully reconnect to the redundant instances while the impacted one recovered. Our engineering team is actively working on identifying and resolving the issue. We will provide another update in 1 hour or sooner once more information becomes available.
