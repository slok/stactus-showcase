        We are still experiencing SMS delivery failures towards Multiple Networks in Brazil for a Subset of Registered SenderIDs. Our engineers are working with our carrier partner to resolve the issue. We expect to provide another update in 2 hours or as soon as more information becomes available.

        We are no longer experiencing SMS delivery failures following a temporary mitigation. However, Registered SenderIDs are currently not being preserved.
