        We have identified that the Verify OTP email delivery delays are related to an ongoing issue impacting Gmail delivery on our email provider, SendGrid.
        Emails are being successfully accepted by Gmail's mail servers; however, Gmail is currently experiencing delays in delivering messages to recipient inboxes. Other email providers are not affected.
        Our teams are actively monitoring the situation and coordinating with SendGrid as they continue to track updates from Google. We expect to provide another update in 2 hours or as soon as more information becomes available.
