      description: |-
        Twilio is continuing to work with Meta to identify customers who were incorrectly charged due to the  unintended early enablement of the new Per Message Pricing (PMP) by Meta.

        As it is now July 1st, 2025 in certain countries, Meta is now rolling out PMP as expected. Therefore, this incident is now resolved.

        Twilio and Meta will reconcile any charges over the next several weeks issuing credits as necessary. Please reach out to your account manager or open a support ticket if you believe you were affected and do not see a correction to your bill.
      resolved: true
