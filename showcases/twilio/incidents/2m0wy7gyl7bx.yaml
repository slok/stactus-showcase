        Our carrier partner has informed us that the Hungarian regulator NMHH has begun enforcing Decree 4/2012 (I.24.), which introduces new screening and blocking obligations for calls terminating in Hungary via international interconnection points that present Hungarian Caller IDs.

        To avoid disruptions in call delivery to Hungarian destinations, we recommend the following actions:

        Recommended Steps:

        - Avoid using Hungarian CLIs (+36 numbers) as Caller IDs on calls into Hungary unless you have a valid domestic interconnection or roaming agreement to justify their use.
        - Where possible, use non-Hungarian CLIs, such as your main business number or an international service number.
        You can quickly provision U.S. numbers (+1) in the Twilio Console and use those for calls to Hungarian recipients.
        - Monitor your call completion rates to Hungarian destinations.

        If you observe abnormal failure patterns, please reach out to Twilio Support for further assistance.

        We’ll provide another update on 10/20/2025 at 12:00 PM PT or sooner as more information becomes available.
