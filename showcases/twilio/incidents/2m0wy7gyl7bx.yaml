        Our carrier partner has informed us that the Hungarian regulator NMHH has begun enforcing Decree 4/2012 (I.24.), which introduces new screening and blocking obligations for calls terminating in Hungary via international interconnection points that present Hungarian Caller IDs.

        To avoid disruptions in call delivery to Hungarian destinations, we recommend the following actions:

        Recommended Steps:

        - Avoid using Hungarian CLIs (+36 numbers) as Caller IDs on calls into Hungary unless you have a valid domestic interconnection or roaming agreement to justify their use.
        - Where possible, use non-Hungarian CLIs, such as your main business number or an international service number.
        You can quickly provision U.S. numbers (+1) in the Twilio Console and use those for calls to Hungarian recipients.
        - Monitor your call completion rates to Hungarian destinations.

        If you observe abnormal failure patterns, please reach out to Twilio Support for further assistance.

        We’ll provide another update on 10/20/2025 at 12:00 PM PT or sooner as more information becomes available.

        Following an amendment to Decree 4/2012 (I.24), calls made to Hungary using fixed or geographic numbers (like +36 1-9...) as a CLI are now likely to be blocked by local carriers, as of October 15, 2025. This will expand to mobile numbers (like +36 20, 30, 70...) starting June 1, 2026.

        This means calls made with Transit Caller ID and Verified Caller ID will be delivered by Twilio on a best-effort basis when you're using a Hungarian CLI.

        Recommended steps:
        - For calls made into Hungary using Verified Caller ID or Transit Caller ID avoid using Hungarian numbers (+36 1-9… and +36 20, 30, 70...) as your CLI as the calls are likely to be blocked.
        - If a Hungary CLI isn’t a priority for your use case, use a non-Hungarian CLI like your main business or international service number. If you need one, you can quickly get a United States (+1) number right in the Twilio Console to use for these calls.

        If you observe abnormal failure patterns, please reach out to Twilio Support for further assistance.
