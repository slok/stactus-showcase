      description: Due to commercial changes and the conclusion of an exclusive International A2P contract At AT&T Mexico, all dedicated short codes and registered alphanumeric sender IDs for international customers may be impacted starting from October 1st. Until the migration to a new partner is finalized, short codes and alphanumeric sender IDs are expected to be replaced. However, message delivery will continue without interruption. We appreciate your patience during this transition and will provide updates as the migration progresses.
