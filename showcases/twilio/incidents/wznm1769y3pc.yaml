        In reference to previous incident https://status.twilio.com/incidents/2m0wy7gyl7bx, Following an amendment to Decree 4/2012 (I.24), calls made to Hungary using fixed or geographic numbers (like +36 1-9...) as a CLI are now likely to be blocked by local carriers, as of October 15, 2025. This will expand to mobile numbers (like +36 20, 30, 70...) starting June 1, 2026.

        This means calls made with Transit Caller ID and Verified Caller ID will be delivered by Twilio on a best-effort basis when you're using a Hungarian CLI.

        Recommended steps:
        - For calls made into Hungary using Verified Caller ID or Transit Caller ID avoid using Hungarian numbers (+36 1-9… and +36 20, 30, 70...) as your CLI as the calls are likely to be blocked.
        - If a Hungary CLI isn’t a priority for your use case, use a non-Hungarian CLI like your main business or international service number. If you need one, you can quickly get a United States (+1) number right in the Twilio Console to use for these calls.

        If you observe abnormal failure patterns, please reach out to Twilio Support for further assistance.
