        We are investigating a vendor service degradation with Virtual Agent (DialogFlow) in all regions. Please find impact details for the following products:
        Programmable Voice: Elevated errors, latency, failed verb executions
        Flex Application: Flex Mobile Android client is unable to receive push notifications since Firebase is down. iOS users are not impacted.
        Conversations: Conversations customer will fail to receive push notifications and updated badge counts. Conversations making use of Dialog flow chatbot participants are also failing to access the Dialog flow service.

        We are continuing to experience service degradation across multiple product features due to a vendor platform issue. Some features and services are starting to see early recovery. We are iterating on workarounds as our vendor partner works to fully restore service across all regions.

        We will provide updates at an hourly cadence, or until we have meaningful information from our vendor.
