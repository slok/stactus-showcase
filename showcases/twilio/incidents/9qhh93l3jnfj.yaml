      description: We are currently observing latency in MMS delivery when sending messages to and from a subset of Twilio phone numbers in Australia specially during the Australia peak traffic between 14:00 until 20:00 PST. We have identified that the primary cause of this latency is an on-going undersea cable fault. Our engineers are working with our carrier partner to resolve the issue. We will provide another update in 1 hour or as soon as more information becomes available.

      description: |-
        We continue to observe latency in MMS delivery reports sent from a subset of Twilio phone numbers in Australia to network subscribers, specially during the peak traffic between 14:00 until 20:00 PST. However the actual MMS are being delivered on time. <br>
        <br>
        For the MMS from network subscribers to a subset of Twilio phone numbers in Australia, we are observing delivery delays. <br>

      description: We have confirmed that this incident is impacting MMS Delivery Report delays when sending messages to and from a subset of Twilio phone numbers in Australia rather than MMS message delivery when sending messages to and from a subset of Twilio phone numbers in Australia, and we can confirm that MMS delivery is operating normally; delayed delivery reports may be more noticeable during peak traffic in Australia between 14:00–20:00 PST. Our investigation indicates the primary contributor is an ongoing undersea cable fault causing increased latency, and our engineers are working closely with our carrier partner to mitigate the impact and restore normal delivery report timing. We will provide another update within 24 hours, or sooner if more information becomes available.
