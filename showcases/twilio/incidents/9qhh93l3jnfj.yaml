      description: "We continue to observe latency in SMS and MMS delivery reports sent from a subset of Twilio phone numbers in Australia to network subscribers, specially during the peak traffic between 14:00 and 20:00 PST. However, the actual SMS and MMS are being delivered on time. \n\nFor the SMS and MMS from network subscribers to a subset of Twilio phone numbers in Australia, we are observing delivery delays.\n\nWe have identified that the primary cause of this latency is an ongoing undersea cable fault. Our engineers are working with our carrier partner to resolve the issue. We will provide another update in 24 hours or as soon as more information becomes available. \n\nThe issue with the MMS delivery from and to Twilio specifically to Telstra 505-01 network has been resolved now. We will provide another update in 24 hours or as soon as more information becomes available."
