      description: We are currently observing latency in MMS delivery when sending messages to and from a subset of Twilio phone numbers in Australia specially during the Australia peak traffic between 14:00 until 20:00 PST. We have identified that the primary cause of this latency is an on-going undersea cable fault. Our engineers are working with our carrier partner to resolve the issue. We will provide another update in 1 hour or as soon as more information becomes available.
