        Our engineers have identified the issue with the Twilio and SendGrid Help Centers, requests are failing across all application surfaces and customers are unable to interact with our Help Center Assistant:
        - Customers with Free Support plans will be unable to contact support
        - Customers with Paid Support will not be able to use the Help Center Assistant, but are unaffected as it relates to contacting support.
        - Intelligent Discovery Assistant that is on the Voice and Messaging Insights in the Twilio Console is also impacted
        We are currently working to deploy a fix and we expect to provide another update in 1 hour or as soon as more information becomes available.
