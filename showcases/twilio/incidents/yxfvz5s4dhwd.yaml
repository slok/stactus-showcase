      description: Twilio Programmable Messaging was degraded for 23 hours between Jan 13th 2025, 2:20AM PST until Jan 14th 2025, 1:26AM PST. During this period of time customers may have experienced a small number of messages sent were not properly updated to a finalized status (FAILED or DELIVERY_UNKNOWN). Consequently, callbacks and EventStream events for these status updates were not triggered. Messages sent after January 14 are unaffected. The issue has now been resolved.
      resolved: true
