      description: 'Beginning at 5:00 Pacific Time, we began experiencing delays in devices connecting to the network due to issues with the primary IMSIs on Super SIM. Devices may experience a connection delay (between 3 and 9 minutes) as they transition to back up IMSIs to restore full connectivity.  Our engineering team is actively working with the affected network provider to resolve the issue. We will provide another update in 1 hour or sooner if more information becomes available.
