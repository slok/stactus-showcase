      description: Our monitoring systems have detected a potential issue with regards to Super SIM Connectivity Data Session Drop. Beginning at 4:20AM UTC, we observed ~16% of active data sessions on Super SIM being dropped. About 4% of devices may still experience connectivity issues. Our engineering team is actively working alongside the affected network provider to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. In the meantime, we kindly suggest that customers reset the connectivity through the console or through the APIs (by reactivating SIMs) if they notice that some of their SIM cards are still experiencing issues. We will provide another update in 4 hours or sooner once more information becomes available.
