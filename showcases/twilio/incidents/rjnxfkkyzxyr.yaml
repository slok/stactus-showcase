      description: |-
        We’re creating this proactive comms in reference to a planned maintenance in all regions between 9:00 PM PST to 11:59PM Pacific Time on 07/29/2025.
        We’ll start the cluster reboot in the next 10 minutes, which will last about 10 seconds. Customers may experience the following during the cluster reboots:
        -Login failures for customers logging in via legacy SSO (customers with enhanced SSO are not impacted) or console.
        -Customers that are already logged in may be logged out from Flex UI or Webchat.
        -Customers using Webchat may be unable to initiate new sessions or see disruptions to their existing sessions (token refresh failure).
        -Customers should be able to re-login after the impact period in case of login failure during the maintenance window.
