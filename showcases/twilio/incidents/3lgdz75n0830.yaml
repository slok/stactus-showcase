      description: Our monitoring systems have detected increased latency for Message Logs due to elevated traffic from MRS to HSS. This is causing delays in processing messaging GET and DELETE requests, with a low number of 5xx errors reported. Our engineering team is actively investigating the issue and working to identify the root cause. We will provide another update in 1 hour or as soon as more information becomes available.
