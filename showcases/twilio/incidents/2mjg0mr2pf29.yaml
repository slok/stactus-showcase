        We continue to experience service disruptions due to the AWS update affecting the US-1 Region. While recovery is underway, full restoration is still in progress. Our teams are working closely with AWS to resolve connectivity and capacity issues. The impact extends to cross-region networking and US1 east, causing intermittent performance degradation.

        Key services impacted include Programmable Voice, Flex & Task Router, Studio, Functions, Assets, and Programmable Messaging with varying degrees of recovery. Requests with a Twilio success code are queued for delivery upon recovery, while those with failure codes need resending post-restoration. We anticipate no data loss once recovery is achieved. Twilio has scaled systems to service current loads and continues to monitor the situations. We will provide an update within 60 minutes or as soon as we have more information.

        We continue to experience service disruptions due to the AWS outage affecting the US-1 Region. While recovery is well underway, full restoration is still in progress. Twilio teams are working closely with AWS to resolve remaining connectivity and capacity issues and to ensure ongoing stability across all regions.

        We are seeing continued improvement across most products; however, AWS is still performing remediation actions, and intermittent errors may continue until their work is fully complete.

        Key services impacted include Functions and Assets, which continue to experience invocation failures. Programmable Voice, Flex & TaskRouter, Studio, Programmable Messaging, and WhatsApp have largely recovered but may still encounter occasional transient errors. SendGrid / Marketing Campaigns customers may continue to see intermittent delays or errors when sending or managing campaigns. Verify traffic remains partially impacted, with a small portion (~0.1%) returning HTTP 503 errors and elevated latency. Lookup is recovering, but still shows increased latency.

        Requests with a Twilio success code remain queued for delivery upon recovery, while those that resulted in failure codes will need to be resent once services are fully restored. We do not anticipate data loss once recovery is complete. Twilio has scaled systems to service current loads and continues to monitor the situation closely. We will provide an update within 60 minutes or as soon as more information becomes available.
