      description: "Our engineering team has identified an issue with studio and is working on mitigating the issue. Any customers who have the Gather widget and who have \"English (United States)\" are impacted. \n\nMost existing customers have \"en-US\" or \"en set\", however because of a previous UI bug any new flows created or modified during Feb 20 2025 to March 12 2025 were defaulted to \"English (United States)\" as the gather_language and would be impacted. \n\nEngineers are working to resolve the issue. We will provide another update in 2 hours, or as soon as we have new information."
