        Our Account Portal is experiencing a partial outage related with reset 2FA causing user and account closures from the Console.
        We are working to restore functionality as soon as possible. We expect to provide another update in 60 minutes or as soon as more information becomes available.

        We are currently investigating reports of unexpected customer account closures. The previous issue—where MFA resets led to user and account closures—has been resolved. However, affected users are still unable to create new accounts, and impacted accounts remain closed. Our team is actively working to determine the root cause and restore access to affected accounts as quickly as possible.
        We expect to provide another update in 60 minutes or as soon as more information becomes available.
