      description: T-Mobile has notified us that their planned maintenance window has been extended. As a result, message processing capacity is reduced, which may cause delays during peak periods—particularly at the top of the hour. While we expect the overall impact to be minimal, we are actively monitoring the situation and making adjustments as needed. We will provide another update in 1 hour or sooner if additional information becomes available.
