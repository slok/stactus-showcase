      description: |-
        Between 09:24 - 09:29 UTC Twilio experienced disruption to Voice and Messaging services in ie1. At this time, all services have recovered and we do not expect any further degradation.

        Voice customers with active calls may have experienced call drops or failures to establish call sessions. Failover did take place to minimize impact. Messaging customers may have experienced a delay in message delivery and, in extremely isolated cases, message failure. Retry redundancy took effect to protect traffic.
