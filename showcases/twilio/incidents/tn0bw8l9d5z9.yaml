      description: Between October 16, 2025, at 21:15 UTC and October 17, 2025, at 19:45 UTC, some inbound SMS messages to Twilio accounts may have failed to be delivered, resulting in error code 30038. This issue was caused by an unexpected behavior following a filtering change. The change has since been reverted, and inbound SMS traffic is now processing as expected.
