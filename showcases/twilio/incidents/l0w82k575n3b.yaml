        We are currently observing intermittent delays in message delivery to T-Mobile Network in the US due to an extended maintenance window on their side, which is temporarily impacting approximately 50% of their capacity.

        Impact is expected only around the top of the hour, when traffic volumes are at their highest. Outside of these peak times, traffic is expected to process normally.

        We are monitoring the situation closely and working with T-Mobile  to obtain updated information during this maintenance window. We will provide another update in 2 hours or as soon as more information becomes available.
