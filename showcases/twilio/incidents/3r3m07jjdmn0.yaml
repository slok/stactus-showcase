      description: From 2025-11-25 19:25 UTC until 2025-12-11 00:23 UTC, a small subset of inbound calls from carriers sending invalid STIR/SHAKEN PASSporTs were erroneously rejected. These calls should have been accepted and completed with a 32021 (warning), but due to a software bug they were instead classified as 32020 (error) and blocked. The issue has been mitigated and inbound calls with invalid PASSporTs are now processed normally.
      resolved: true
