      description: We are currently investigating an issue in which some video participants are unable to generate tokens correctly/ taking longer due to the video-rtc-services-register service’s inability to access dynamoDB. This impacts the production Twilio environment, affecting users attempting to join or establish video sessions through Video Rooms. While the service remains degraded but usable, affected participants may experience delays or failures when attempting to join video calls. The scope of customer impact depends on the percentage of requests currently failing and how long the dynamoDB access issue persists. Users should be advised that video functionality may be intermittently unavailable during this incident.  Our engineers are working to resolve the issue. We will provide another update in 30 minutes or as soon as more information becomes available.
