      description: Flex UI Teams View was degraded for 11 minutes between 12:05 and 12:16 UTC Time on 03/02/2025. During this period of time customers wouldn't be able to create filters on Flex UI Teams View. However, there was no impact on already existing filters and UI would have worked as expected, unless there was any new filter created by the supervisor.
      resolved: true
