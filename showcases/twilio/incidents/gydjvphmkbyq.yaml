      description: Between 09/10 at 8:00 PM PDT and 09/11 02:03 PM PDT customers may have experienced message delivery issues on WhatsApp.  This was caused by a vendor outage as part of "WhatsApp Account Ownership Is Moving to You" update that was shared previously by Twilio. This is since resolved and confirmed all systems are operational.
