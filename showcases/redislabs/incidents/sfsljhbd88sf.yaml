        Redis Cloud is currently experiencing a service disruption due to a global outage reported by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This is affecting several components of our platform, including:

        - Redis Cloud API
        - Heroku and Vercel integrations
        - Documentation portal
        - Scaling and provisioning of new subscriptions

        At this time, database connectivity and availability are functioning normally, and remain accessible and unaffected.

        We are actively monitoring the situation and working with GCP to resolve the issue. Updates will be posted here as more information becomes available.

        Thank you for your patience.
