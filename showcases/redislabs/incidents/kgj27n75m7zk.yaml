        We are currently experiencing an issue which may affect the provisioning of new subscriptions and the updating of existing subscriptions. As a result, users may observe their clusters appearing under maintenance. However, there is no impact to database functionality, and all existing clusters are operating as expected.

        Our engineering team is actively investigating the issue and working to resolve it as soon as possible. We will provide further updates as progress is made.
