        We’ve identified an issue with an upstream service provider that is currently impacting access to parts of our platform. This includes intermittent availability of parts of our platform.

        Impacted components:
        - Redis Cloud admin console (cloud.redis.io)
        - Redis Cloud API
        - redis.io

        Please note: Redis database connectivity and performance are not affected.

        Our team is actively monitoring the situation and working closely with the upstream provider to restore stable access. We’ll continue to share updates as they become available.

        If you need assistance, please contact us at support@redis.com. Thank you for your patience.

        	•	Redis Cloud admin console (cloud.redis.io)
        	•	Redis Cloud API
        	•	redis.io

        The issue stemmed from an upstream service provider. While service has stabilized, we are currently awaiting final confirmation from the provider before fully closing this incident.

        As always, Redis database connectivity remained unaffected.
