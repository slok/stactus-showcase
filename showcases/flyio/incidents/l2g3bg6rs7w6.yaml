        We are investigating an issue causing application log search to be unavailable. This is affecting the Fly Metrics log search panels, and historical application logs initially returned from the `fly logs` command.

        Streaming logs using `fly logs`, the Live Logs page in the dashboard, and Fly Log Shipper services continue to work as expected.
