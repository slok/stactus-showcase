      description: |-
        Between approximately 10:58 UTC and 11:25 UTC, Fly.io experienced degraded proxy performance in multiple regions, including IAD, FRA, EWR and LHR.
        During this period, users may have observed intermittent connection errors or elevated response times.

        The elevated traffic has subsided, and proxy performance is back to normal.
      resolved: true
