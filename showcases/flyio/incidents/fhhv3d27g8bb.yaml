      description: |-
        New machine/volume creates in IAD regions may fail as there is no host capacity available.

        Any workloads currently running will continue to run; it is also still possible to update existing machines/volumes.

        Increasing `fly scale count` in these regions may not work. Blue-green deploys may also be unavailable at the moment, as well as deploys with `release_command`.

        We are provisioning additional capacity in this region.
