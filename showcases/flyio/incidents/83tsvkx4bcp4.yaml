      description: "This incident has been resolved. Networking in IAD has remained stable over the past two hours. \n\nThis was caused by a routing issue with an upstream networking provider that impacted connectivity to some hosts in IAD. We applied a change to work around the bad routing, and the underlying issue that caused this in the first place has been identified and fixed."
