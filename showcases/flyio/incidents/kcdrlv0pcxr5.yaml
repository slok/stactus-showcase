        We are currently experiencing network issues related to an upstream provider, causing high packet loss to certain destinations. We are working to shift traffic away from the impacted provider.

        This affects mainly the IAD region but may also impact other regions. Impacted apps will continue to run, may experience degraded public and private network connectivity at this time.

      description: Traffic across North America has been shifted to alternative upstreams and packet loss metrics have returned to nominal values. We are monitoring for any further issues.
