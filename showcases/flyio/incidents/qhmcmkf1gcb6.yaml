      description: We have identified an upstream issue that prevented static egress IPv6 addresses in BOM from reaching parts of the Internet and are currently working with upstreams for a fix. Machines without a static egress IPv6 address are not affected. For affected machines, consider forcing IPv4 for outbound connectivity or de-allocating the egress IP if not needed via `fly m egress-ip release`.
