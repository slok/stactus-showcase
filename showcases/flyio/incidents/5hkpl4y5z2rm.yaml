      description: We're investigating reports of "unauthorized" errors when doing `fly deploy` operations using the `--depot=false` parameter. This is not enabled by default, and Depot builders are unaffected. If you're seeing this error, try deploying with `--depot=true` to work around problems with legacy Fly builders.

      description: We're continuing to investigate the issue. Both legacy Fly builders and Buildkit builders are affected by this - if you're running into this error, please try deploying with `--depot=true`. (The default `fly deploy` and `fly launch` use Depot builders, which remain unaffected by this issue.)
