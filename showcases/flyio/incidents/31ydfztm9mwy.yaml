        From roughly 11:00AM Pacific to 3:00PM Pacific, Depot builders were unable to complete deploys (https://status.depot.dev/cmafni8la004z9pwuozks8vwx). During this time, deploys defaulted back to our legacy Fly builders, and users may have seen slower-than-usual deploys depending on the size of the build.

        This has been resolved, and deploys are now defaulting to Depot builders again.
      resolved: true
