        We have identified the issue and are actively working on a fix. In the meantime, you may work around by destroying your remote builder app and recreating it in another region nearby, e.g Rio de Janeiro (gig).

        Identify the name of your builder app (prefixed with "fly-builder-"):
        fly apps list

        Destroy the builder:
        fly apps destroy <builder-app-name>

        Redeploy with a builder app in another region:
        FLY_REMOTE_BUILDER_REGION=gig fly deploy
