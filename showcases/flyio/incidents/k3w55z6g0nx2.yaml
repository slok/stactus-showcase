        We are currently investigating issues with the log search in the fly-metrics.net grafana dashboard. Users may see log queries take longer than usual, or fail with a timeout error. Retries generally succeed.

        Viewing logs via the fly.io/dashboard log viewer, `flyctl logs`, and the fly-log-shipper are not impacted by this.
