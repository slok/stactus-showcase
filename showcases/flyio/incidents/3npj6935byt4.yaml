      description: "We have identified elevated error rates registering new machines with our global state tracking service on some hosts. We have identified the issue and are deploying a fix. \n\nUsers may have seen elevated machine create, start, or deployment failures over the past ~20 minutes."

      description: "A fix has been rolled out and most hosts are registering machines as normal. A few hosts remain with elevated error rates, we are continuing to fix these. \nUsers who experience an error creating or deploying a new machine should re-try the operation."

      description: "While Machine registration error rates have improved, we are now seeing elevated error rates verifying user tokens during some actions. \n\nUsers may see errors like \"failed to launch VM: permission_denied: bolt token: failed to verify service token: no verified tokens\" when deploying or creating machines. \n\nWe are investigating"

      description: "We saw some improvement from the previous fix, however errors remained elevated on some hosts. \nWe have identified the root cause of the remaining errors as a communication issue between the hosts and our Token database. We are preparing a fix that should resolve these."

      description: A fix has been deployed across all impacted hosts. We are seeing a sharp reduction in Token errors since 20:00 UTC and other metrics are recovering as well. We are continuing to monitor closely
