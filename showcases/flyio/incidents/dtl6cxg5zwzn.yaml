      description: |-
        The Machines API issues stem from a propagation delay in our global state store, Corrosion.

        We have completed deploying a configuration change to our Corrosion cluster and will be applying these changes to each node shortly. We expect improvement once the changes are applied.

        In the meantime users may still see degraded machines API and proxy performance, especially with newly created machines
