        We have applied a fix and historic logs are now backfilling into fly-metrics.net.  New logs will be accessible once the backfill is complete.

        New app logs are once again stably flowing into the fly-metrics.net dashboard. Users should see and be able to search all app logs from 22:30 UTC onwards. We are continuing to monitor the customer logs cluster to ensure continued stability.

        Not all historical logs were able to be backfilled. Many users will see missing or incomplete logs for the period between 08:00 - 22:30 UTC Oct-06-2025.
