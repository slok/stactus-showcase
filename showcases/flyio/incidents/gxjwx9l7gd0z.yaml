        We are investigating sporadic build failures mentioning Docker rate limits on "unauthenticated pulls" and error 429.

        In the meantime, workarounds to try in order are:
        1. Use `fly deploy --depot=false`
        2. Use `fly deploy --buildkit`
        3. Install Docker locally and use `--local-only` with Fly deploy
