        We are investigating sporadic build failures mentioning Docker rate limits on "unauthenticated pulls" and error 429.

        In the meantime, workarounds to try in order are:
        1. Use `fly deploy --depot=false`
        2. Use `fly deploy --buildkit`
        3. Install Docker locally and use `--local-only` with Fly deploy

      description: We're still rolling out configurations to mitigate this issue. Note that this issue only affects users with builders in some US regions. In the meanwhile, trying the recommended workarounds, or relocating your builder (Settings -> App builders) to either Dallas, Chicago or Toronto should allow your builds to complete successfully.
