        We are investigating issues with WireGuard over websockets (the default connection mode in flyctl).
        `flyctl ssh`, `flyctl proxy`, `flyctl logs` commands as well as others may fail.

        If you are on a network that allows UDP connections, running `fly wg websockets disable` may fix the issue as a workaround.
