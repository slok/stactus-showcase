        The Depot service is currently degraded due to a database outage. We're continuing to monitor for recovery. Customers can also follow the Depot status page at https://status.depot.dev/ for updates.

        Customers that need to deploy can use legacy Fly.io hosted builders with `fly deploy --depot=false`
