      description: "A small number of hosts in the NRT (Tokyo) and SIN (Singapore) are reporting delayed metrics to the hosted Grafana charts at fly-metrics.net. Users with machines on impacted hosts will see delayed or spotty metrics in their Grafana charts.  \n\nOnly metrics for these machines are impacted. The underlying machines continue to receive and serve traffic as usual, and all machine actions(stopping, starting, deploys etc.)  continue to work normally. \n\nWe are processing the backlog of metrics on these hosts, but metrics will be delayed until this is complete."

      description: "We are continuing to process the metrics backlog in NRT and SIN. Progress is being made, but due to the volume of metrics this may still take some time to fully complete. \n\nAt this time users with machines on impacted hosts will see metrics beginning to backfill into fly-metrics.net. However many will not be fully caught up yet.\n\nThis impacts metrics only, the underlying machines continue to work normally."
