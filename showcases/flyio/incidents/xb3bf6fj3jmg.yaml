      description: "We are currently performing maintenance on the log cluster that powers log search in fly-metrics.net. Users may see slow queries or queries timing out during this period. \n\nViewing live logs via the `flyctl logs` command and from the log tab of the fly.io dashboard continue to work as normal, as does shipping logs using the Fly Log Shipper."
