      description: "# **Incident Postmortem - Intermittent SSO Availability**\n\n**Date of Incident:** 2025-07-14  \n**Time of Incident \\(UTC\\):** 22:00UTC - 11:23UTC   \n**Service\\(s\\) Affected:** SSO  \n**Impact Duration:** 1 hour and 23 minutes\n\n## **Summary**\n\nOn July 14, 2025 1Password’s SSO services were intermittently slow or unavailable for approximately 1 hour and 23 minutes. This was due to an outage with an upstream provider which 1Password backend services rely on to verify DNS lookups for SSO authentication. You can read the provider’s incident report [here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-1-1-1-1-incident-on-july-14-2025/), which outlines in detail what occurred and how they remediated the issue. \n\nFor the duration of the incident 1Password customers would have experienced failed or slow SSO login attempts. We apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused our users. \n\n‌\n\n## **Impact on customers**\n\nCustomers accessing 1Password cloud services experienced delayed responses and timeout error messages.\n\n* **SSO Login:** Users logging in via SSO experienced failures, timeout errors or slow responses\n\n## **Scope**\n\n* **Number of affected Customers \\(approximate\\):** Most users attempting to authenticate using SSO\n* **Geographic Regions Affected:** All\n\n## **What Happened?**\n\nAt 22:00UTC on July 14, 2025 1Password engineers were alerted to customer timeouts and failures when trying to use SSO as an authentication method. After diagnosing the issue, engineers discovered the source of the issue was an outage with an upstream provider when looking up and verifying OIDC provider hostnames. \n\n‌\n\n* **Timeline of Events \\(UTC\\):**  \n\n    * 22:00 - Incident initially detected by 1Password \n    * 22:13 - Upstream provider identifies issue\n    * 22:59 - Upstream provider implements a fix\n    * 23:30 - Incident resolved  \n    \n* **Root Cause Analysis:** The third party provider 1Password uses for DNS lookup and verification failed. \n\n## **How Was It Resolved?**\n\n* **Resolution Steps:** Our third party provider mitigated the issue. \n* **Verification of Resolution:** We closely monitored systems to ensure SSO logins were successful.\n\n## **What We Are Doing to Prevent Future Incidents**\n\n* We are investigating the addition of an additional DNS provider to provide redundancy."
