        We have temporarily unpublished 1Password extension from the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store to address a bug. Current users are unaffected, and our team is actively working on deploying a new version to the Edge store.

        This was a proactive measure to ensure the best user experience. The extension will be republished as soon as the corrected version is ready and approved. In the meantime, the Edge extension is available via the Chrome Web Store. We appreciate your patience and will post an update once it's available again.
