      description: "**Date of Incident:** 2025-07-22  \n**Time of Incident \\(UTC\\):** 10:40 - 06:30  \n**Services Affected: Admin Console Activity log and User Details page**  \n**Impact Duration:** 43 hrs\n\n## Summary\n\nA change to our internal data model that removed an unused type definition led to multiple failures in the Reports system.\n\n## Impact on Customers\n\n* **Events API and Reporting:** The activity log widget failed to display activities.\n* Admin console: User details page failed to display user details\n\n## What Happened?\n\nA software update introduced an API change that caused a mismatch between client and server.  The Audit log page in the admin console was still collecting data but was not able to render it. \n\n* **Timeline of Events \\(UTC\\):**\n\n    * 10:40 : Detected by 1Password personnel and root cause identified\n    * 10:42: Issue Identified\n    * 13:38 Fix created and testing initiated\n    * 06:30: Fix released, Service fully restored\n    \n* **Root Cause Analysis:** A User State was removed from the [1Password.com](http://1Password.com) server but not the client. This was a breaking API change.\n\n## How Was It Resolved?\n\n* **Resolution Steps:** The user state in the 1Password client was removed to get the server and client back into parity.\n* **Verification of Resolution:** 1Password engineering tested the changes and validated that full system functionality was restored.\n\n## What We Are Doing to Prevent Future Incidents\n\n* **User State change process: 1Password is investigating how to catch breaking API changes by implementing additional end-to-end tests in the CI pipeline.**\n* Audit log architecture change: Engineering is investigating a rework of the audit log page to change how it aggregates data so that it is not reliant on an endpoint. This would mitigate future occurrences that caused this issue.\n\n## Next Steps and Communication\n\n* No action is required from our customers at this time.\n* If you are still experiencing issues, please contact our support team at [support@1password.com](mailto:support@1password.com).\n\nWe are committed to providing a reliable and stable service, and we are taking the necessary steps to learn from this event and prevent it from happening again. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe 1Password Team"
