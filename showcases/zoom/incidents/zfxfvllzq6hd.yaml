      description: "Enable Nested app authentication for “Outlook Add-in SSO\" authentication flow is not functioning as expected.  The team has identified the problem and is scheduled to deploying the fix this evening, January 17.  \n \nThe launch of this feature is underway and customer communications inviting admins to enable it have been sent. However the implementation of the feature is not performing as expected and requires a deployment to remediate.\n \nThere is no impact to end users as this is an administrative function only."
