        Our carrier partner has successfully resolved the issue. Following a detailed investigation, we confirmed that the provider exchange functioned normally and was not impacted.
        However, a subset of customers in Japan experienced temporary disruptions with Zoom native inbound and outbound calls. Service has now been fully restored.
