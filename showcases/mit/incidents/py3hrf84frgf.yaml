        On March 31, 2023, Information Systems and Technology (IS&T) is enhancing our authentication configuration for Microsoft cloud applications using Azure, in order to keep pace with Microsoft's updated security posture.

        When implemented, these changes will require users to re-authenticate using Touchstone as active email client sessions expire, in order to adopt the new settings, for Microsoft-integrated applications, including Outlook, Apple Mail, Office 365, and OneDrive. Apps and integrations connected to Microsoft services may need to be re-enabled.
