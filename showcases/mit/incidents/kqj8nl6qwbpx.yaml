        Microsoft 365 and Outlook services are currently down and inaccessible.  Email is inaccessible because of this service disruption. This also affects other M365 services like Teams and Sharepoint.

        Microsoft is investigating an issue in which users may be unable to access Outlook features and services. Live updates from Microsoft can be found at https://x.com/MSFT365Status.

        We'll update the MIT community as we receive additional information.

        Microsoft has identified a recent code change to a portion of their M365 service infrastructure that they suspect is causing the login issue. They have also reverted the code change, and are monitoring service health telemetry to confirm if the reversion is returning service to expected functionality.

        Outlook access has appeared to have been restored. IS&T is monitoring Microsoft status to confirm when M365 service is fully restored.
