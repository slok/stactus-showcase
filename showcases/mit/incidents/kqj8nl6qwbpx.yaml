        Microsoft 365 and Outlook services are currently down and inaccessible.  Email is inaccessible because of this service disruption. This also affects other M365 services like Teams and Sharepoint.

        Microsoft is investigating an issue in which users may be unable to access Outlook features and services. Live updates from Microsoft can be found at https://x.com/MSFT365Status.

        We'll update the MIT community as we receive additional information.
