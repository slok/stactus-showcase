        IS&T staff have identified the problem with oc11-bk-ent-1, and are working on implementing a solution, but that will take some time.  Right now new connections to oc11-bk-ent-1 are disabled, and most existing connections were killed.  All data that was already backed up remains intact on the server, and wil lbe accessible once this problem has been resolved.
        We will post another update at around 1pm
