      description: We have partially reactivated the Statuspages of affected customers. The hosted pages should be up, and the API capabilities have been restored so affected customers can use this to manage their pages while work is done to restore access to the manage portal. We have defined two processes to resolution of the issues impacting some customers. These processes each involve multiple stages of work. We are currently working on one of the processes and we will provide more detail as we progress through resolution.

      description: A small number of Atlassian customers continue to experience service outages and are unable to access their sites. Our global engineering teams are working 24/7 to make progress on this incident. At this time, we have rebuilt functionality for over 35% of the users who are impacted by the service outage, with no reported data loss. The rebuild stage is particularly complex due to several steps that are required to validate sites and verify data. These steps require extra time, but are critical to ensuring the integrity of rebuilt sites. We apologize for the length and severity of this incident and have taken steps to avoid a recurrence in the future.

        We have restored functionality for 49% of users impacted by the outage. We are taking a batch-based approach to restoring customers, and to-date, this process has been semi-automated. We are beginning to shift towards a more automated process to restore sites. That said, there are still a number of steps required before we hand a site to customers for review and acceptance. We are restoring affected customers identified by a mix of multiple variables including site size, complexity, edition, tenure, and several other factors in groups of up to 60 at a time. The full restoration process involves our engineering teams, our customer support teams, and our customer, and has three steps:
        1. Technical restoration involving meta-data recovery, data restores across a number of services, and ensuring the data across the different systems is working correctly for product and ecosystem apps
        2. Verification of site functionality to ensure the technical restoration has worked as expected
        3. Lastly, working directly with the affected customer to enable them to verify their data and functionality before enabling for their users
        We have also contacted all customers who are *up next* for step 3 in the site restoration process described above. These customers are aware that they are next in queue through their support ticket and/or via a support engineer.
        We have proactively reached out to technical contacts and system admins at all impacted customers, and opened support tickets for each of them. However, we learned that some customers have not yet heard from us or engaged with our support team.

        We have now restored functionality for 53% of users impacted by the outage.

        As outlined in yesterday’s update, we are restoring affected customers using a three step process:

        1. Technical restoration of affected sites
        2. Internal validation of restored sites
        3. Validating with affected customers before enabling their users

        By automating some of our validation steps, we have now reduced time for internal validation of restored sites by half, which allows our support engineers to more quickly engage restored customers for validation and full site handover.

        We have made significant progress over the last 24 hours and have now restored functionality for 62% of users impacted by the outage.

        We have also doubled the size of the batches we are pushing through the restoration process, which was a result of optimizing automated processes as well as accelerating our restoration speed. Our global engineering teams continue to work 24/7, and we expect to progress quickly through technical restoration of remaining customer sites over the weekend.

        We have now restored 78% of users impacted by the outage as we continue to move with more speed and accuracy. Our teams will continue to restore sites through the weekend, and we expect to have all sites restored no later than end of day Tuesday, April 19th PT. As we restore your site and hand it over to you for validation, please reach out to our teams should you find any issues so that our support engineers can work to get you fully restored.
