        We identified a configuration change to our edge networking that affected our ability to route traffic for Public Statuspages that use a custom domain. This occurred from 02:55 to 03:13 UTC, at which point the issue was rectified.

        During this period, the ability to view these status pages was unavailable, but the ability to manage them remained functional, ensuring that no updates or notifications were lost.
      resolved: true
