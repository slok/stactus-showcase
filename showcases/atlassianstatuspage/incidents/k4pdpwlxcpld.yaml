      description: "We have determined that the connectivity issue is due to a DNS name resolution problem affecting certain ISPs in Brazil, which are unable to resolve *.statuspage.io domains. This issue does not impact all Brazilian customers and subscribers; it varies depending on the customer's or subscriber's ISP. Customers using custom domains for their status pages are not affected. While your Statuspage remains available, ISP configurations are preventing traffic from resolving the Statuspage domain. \n\nWe are exploring mitigation strategies, but we advise affected customers to contact their ISP to understand why their ISP cannot resolve *.statuspage.io domains."

        We are actively working with ISPs to resolve the current issues and to better understand the recent changes that have contributed to these problems. We also encourage our customers to contact their ISPs, as this appears to be an ISP-specific issue. Our investigation show that statuspage.io domains can be resolved using Google or Cloudflare DNS resolvers, such as 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8. Please refer to the steps outlined in our community post to access all Statuspage-based domains effectively.
