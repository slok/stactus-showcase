        ### **SUMMARY**

        From 06:00 UTC to 07:45 UTC on October 28, 2023, Atlassian customers using Statuspage had intermittent issues with all Statuspage functionality. The event occurred due to a database performance issue during a [scheduled database maintenance](https://metastatuspage.com/incidents/s21b66328h9j). This impacted customers in all regions. The incident was detected within one minute by monitoring the upgrade process and mitigated by rolling back to a known good snapshot which put Statuspage systems into a known good state. The total time to resolution was about one hour and 45 minutes.

        ### **IMPACT**

        The overall impact was between 06:00 UTC and 07:45 UTC October 28, 2023. This incident affected Statuspage customers from all regions and caused intermittent backend errors on all Statuspage activity including viewing pages, adding subscribers, and creating/updating events. We performed a rollback operation during recovery to return to a known good state.

        ### **ROOT CAUSE**

        The issue was caused by database performance issues after a routine database maintenance and upgrade. As a result, our backends returned intermittent errors to several user requests.

        ### **REMEDIAL ACTIONS PLAN & NEXT STEPS**

        We take the utmost care to provide a highly reliable service. We will pursue several preventive measures to ensure that this situation does not occur in the future, including:

        * Fixing the cause of the performance issues before future upgrades; and
        * Improving our testing process for database upgrades to catch potential performance issues.

        We apologize to customers whose services were impacted during this incident; we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability.

        Thanks,

        Atlassian Customer Support
