        Our team has identified an issue relating to the underlying data used to populate our System Metrics charts, which could cause display errors to appear on customer Statuspages.

        We are investigating possible solutions, and in the meantime, the System Metrics functionality within Statuspage has been disabled to minimize the impact to users viewing Statuspages.

        We will provide an update when we are able to confirm that the functionality can be re-enabled without causing errors for customer Statuspages.

        Please note, this should not impact the ability of customers to use Statuspage to post publicly about the status of their own systems for overall health and availability.

        Statuspage is operating normally except for the System metrics feature, which is disabled for the time being to minimize the impact to users viewing Statuspages.

        Customers can continue to post publicly about the status of their own systems for overall health and availability.

        We are actively engaged in exploring possible solutions and plan to provide further update by early next week.
