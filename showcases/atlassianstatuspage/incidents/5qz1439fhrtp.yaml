        Our team has identified an issue relating to the underlying data used to populate our System Metrics charts, which could cause display errors to appear on customer Statuspages.

        We are investigating possible solutions, and in the meantime, the System Metrics functionality within Statuspage has been disabled to minimize the impact to users viewing Statuspages.

        We will provide an update when we are able to confirm that the functionality can be re-enabled without causing errors for customer Statuspages.

        Please note, this should not impact the ability of customers to use Statuspage to post publicly about the status of their own systems for overall health and availability.

        Statuspage is operating normally except for the System metrics feature, which is disabled for the time being to minimize the impact to users viewing Statuspages.

        Customers can continue to post publicly about the status of their own systems for overall health and availability.

        We are actively engaged in exploring possible solutions and plan to provide further update by early next week.

        Rolling out of the new System Metrics implementation is slowed down to ensure it performs well for the rolled out customers. We continue to monitor progress and plan gradual rollout to other customers.

        The next update will be on Friday, Feb 20, 2026 or sooner if we achieve significant progress.

        New System Metrics has been rolled out to the majority of our customers, and we are actively monitoring its performance.

        As Librato has deprecated their platform, we are in the process of removing the Librato integration from our product.

        Our next update is planned for Monday, February 23, 2026.
