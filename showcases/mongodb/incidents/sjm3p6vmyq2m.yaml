        ## Incident Summary

        On September 2, 2024 between 8:30 UTC to 10:15 UTC, some MongoDB customers were unable to log in to MongoDB Atlas Management UI.

        During that time, MongoDB experienced an abnormally high volume of traffic on our login page that caused us to hit our rate limiting thresholds which caused some customers to see their authentication requests to the MongoDB Atlas Management UI rejected.

        Once login volume subsided, login availability was restored.

        Note: This incident had no impact on customer Atlas Clusters. UI authentication is independent of Atlas Cluster authentication.

        ## Root Cause

        Our authentication services were not able to scale quickly enough to react to the sudden increase in logins.

        ## MongoDB Actions

        We are updating our login page to provide clearer and more actionable error messaging. We are also adding additional support toÂ  scale better during traffic spikes.

        ## Recommended Customer Actions

        No further customer action required
