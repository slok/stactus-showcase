        We are investigating reports of sharded clusters metrics pages resulting in a 404 error in both Cloud Manager and Atlas. This does not affect replica sets, Flex clusters, Serverless, or shared tier clusters. Cluster health is unaffected.

        As a workaround, users can navigate to their individual shards' metrics pages.
