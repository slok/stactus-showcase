      description: "We have identified an issue where Atlas users with either Organization, Project Read Only, or Observability Viewer permissions may be unable to view any cluster metrics pages. Affected users will see a 404 error page. \n\nAs a workaround, Project Owners are still able to view metrics.\n\nThis affects both Atlas and Atlas for Government environments.\n\nCluster health is unaffected."
