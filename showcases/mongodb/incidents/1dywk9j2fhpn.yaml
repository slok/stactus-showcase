        We have identified an issue causing the following symptoms:
        - Atlas Data Explorer connections and queries failing
        - Atlas Data Federation and Online Archive queries failing, as well as the creation of new Data Federation or Online Archive instances
        - Atlas Stream Processing being interrupted
        - MongoDB Charts data being delayed

        Affected users will see the above symptoms, often with timeout or host not found errors.

        Underlying cluster health is unaffected, including Atlas search queries.

        Additionally, Vercel users may not be able to get directly to Atlas from within Vercel. As a workaround, users are encouraged to login directly to Atlas at cloud.mongodb.com
