        We have identified an issue with an upstream provider that is interfering with our ability to respond to chat messages from users. Affected users will be able to send chat messages to MongoDB, but may not see replies in a timely manner.

        Users with support subscriptions are encouraged to file support cases at this time either through the Atlas UI or directly at support.mongodb.com

        Thanks in advance for your patience.
