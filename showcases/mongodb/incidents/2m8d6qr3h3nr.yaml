        Cloud Operations remain delayed with degraded performance. Access to backing clusters is unaffected. We are also observing a degradation in monitoring visibility, with approximately 20% of metrics destined for DataDog being dropped.

        We are observing signs of recovery, with provisioning speeds returning to normal in all regions outside of US-EAST-1. Provisioning within US-EAST-1 remains significantly degraded.

        Next Steps: We are closely monitoring the situation and the official AWS status page.

        We are experiencing delays in provisioning additional resources for Triggers apps and ability to register. Accessing cluster data through the Data Explorer Atlas UI is also degraded.
