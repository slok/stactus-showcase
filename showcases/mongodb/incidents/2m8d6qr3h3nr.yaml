        Cloud Operations remain delayed with degraded performance. Access to backing clusters is unaffected. We are also observing a degradation in monitoring visibility, with approximately 20% of metrics destined for DataDog being dropped.

        We are observing signs of recovery, with provisioning speeds returning to normal in all regions outside of US-EAST-1. Provisioning within US-EAST-1 remains significantly degraded.
