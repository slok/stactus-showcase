        We are investigating reports of Atlas Data Federation and Online Archive schema tables failing to load. As a workaround, please connect directly and run the sqlGetSchema command: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/sql-interface/schema/view/
        If that does not work, you may need to generate the schema first: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/sql-interface/schema/create/#create-schema-using-mongosh
      investigating: true
